  abstract = {Driving speed is an important factor in road safety. Speed not only affects the severity of a crash, but is also related to the risk of being involved in a crash. This paper discusses the most important empirical studies into speed and crash rate with an emphasis on the more recent studies. The majority of these studies looked at absolute speed, either at individual vehicle level or at road section level. Respectively, they found evidence for an exponential function and a power function between speed and crash rate. Both types of studies found evidence that crash rate increases faster with an increase in speed on minor roads than on major roads. At a more detailed level, lane width, junction density, and traffic flow were found to interact with the speed{\textendash}crash rate relation. Other studies looked at speed dispersion and found evidence that this is also an important factor in determining crash rate. Larger differences in speed between vehicles are related to a higher crash rate. Without exception, a vehicle that moved (much) faster than other traffic around it, had a higher crash rate. With regard to the rate of a (much) slower moving vehicle, the evidence is inconclusive.},

In the geospatial domain, it may not be clear where a mountain, stream, or valley ends and begins, a problem carried over when such entities are catalogued in gazetteers. In this paper, we take two gazetteers, GeoNames and SwissNames3D, and perform matching {\textendash} identifying records in each that are about the same entity {\textendash} across a sample of natural feature records. We first perform rule-based matching, establishing competitive results, then apply machine learning using Random Forests, a method well-suited to the matching task. We report on the performance of a wider array of matching features than has been previously studied, including domain-specific ones such as feature type, land cover class, and elevation. Our results show an increase in performance using machine learning over rules, with a notable performance gain from considering feature types, but negligible gains from other specialized matching features. We argue that future work in this area should strive to be more reproducible and report results on a realistic testing pipeline including candidate selection, feature extraction, and classification.},

  abstract = {Ad hoc keyword search engines built using modern information retrieval methods do a good job of handling fine-grained queries. However, they perform poorly at facilitating spatial and spatially-embedded thematic exploration of the results, despite the fact that many queries, e.g. civil war, refer to different documents and topics in different places. This is not for lack of data: geographic information, such as place names, events, and coordinates are common in unstructured document collections on the web. The associations between geographic and thematic contents in these documents can provide a rich groundwork to organize information for exploratory research. In this paper we describe the architecture of an interactive thematic map search engine, Frankenplace, designed to facilitate document exploration at the intersection of theme and place. The map interface enables a user to zoom the geographic context of their query in and out, and quickly explore through thousands of search results in a meaningful way. And by combining topic models with geographically contextualized search results, users can discover related topics based on geographic context. Frankenplace utilizes a novel indexing method called geoboost for boosting terms associated with cells on a discrete global grid. The resulting index factors in the geographic scale of the place or feature mentioned in related text, the relative textual scope of the place reference, and the overall importance of the containing document in the document network. The system is currently indexed with over 5 million documents from the web, including the English Wikipedia and online travel blog entries. We demonstrate that Frankenplace can support four distinct types of exploratory search tasks while being adaptive to scale and location of interest.},

Specifically, we highlight three areas worth further study: 1) information about geographic processes and change in text, 2) geographic information where relational context is more important than spatial context, and 3) geographic entities referenced in text that take on thematic (non-spatial) roles.},

We present a novel technique for place name disambiguation (also known as toponym resolution) that uses Bayesian inference to assign categories to lists or tables containing place names, and then interprets individual toponyms based on the most likely category assignments. The categories are defined as nodes in hierarchies along three orthogonal dimensions: place types (e.g., cities, capitals, rivers, etc.), geographic containers, and prominence (e.g., based on population).},

Drawing on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (2000), a multi-relational database, an examination is undertaken of the occurrence, nature and extent of social exclusion within and between seaside resorts in England. The study findings reveal that seaside districts, wards and resorts are experiencing higher levels of multiple deprivation than might be expected. In addition, it shows that while there is remarkable similarity in the nature and extent of multiple deprivation being experienced, variations in the socio-economic characteristics of those resorts most affected suggest that their predicament is more complex than first appears. Three important implications for resort restructuring are highlighted. First, it must avoid being too tourism centric and instead should adopt a more holistic approach. Second a `one size fit' approach is inappropriate and third, there is an urgent need for further in-depth research.},

In this paper, an automatic method for DTM extraction in urban areas is presented. The method is based on an initial approximation of the DTM determined by using the road network, followed by an iterative processing technique that enables computing the final (``true'') DTM. For detection of roads, segmentations based on normal direction, edge detection and height difference are used. Based on our preliminary tests, some of which are presented in this paper, the results point to a promising solution.},

Here we highlight the challenges of geocoding such referents and propose a general formal representation that employs background knowledge, semantic approximations and rules, and fuzzy linguistic variables.

  abstract = {Social media applications such as Twitter and Facebook are fast becoming a key instrument in gaining situational awareness (understanding the bigger picture of the situation) during disasters. This has provided multiple opportunities to gather relevant information in a timely manner to improve disaster response. In recent years, identifying crisis-related social media posts is analysed as an automatic task using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques. However, such supervised learning algorithms require labelled training data in the early hours of a crisis. Recently, multiple manually labelled disaster-related open-source twitter datasets have been released. In this work, we collected 192, 948 tweets by combining a number of such datasets, preprocessed, filtered and duplicate removed, which resulted in 117, 954 tweets. Then we evaluated the performance of multiple ML and DL algorithms in classifying disaster-related tweets in three settings, namely ``in-disaster'', ``out-disaster'' and ``cross-disaster''. Our results show that the Bidirectional LSTM model with Word2Vec embeddings performs well for the tweet classification task in all three settings. We also make available the preprocessing steps and trained weights for future research.},

  abstract = {Congested road and air networks, coupled with the idea that transport systems should be balanced, have spawned the field of intercity intermodal passenger transport which is based on travel across connected networks that is as seamless as possible. There is a very large number of attributes that affect the objective and subjective quality of travel. Intercity public transport planning therefore requires an excellent understanding of connections between different services and how the quality of these connections affects passengers, operators and the society at large. This article reviews the vast literature over the last 20 years from Europe, North America and Asia that is related to intercity travel, the connectivity of transport and cooperation between different modes of transport and presents a simple yet powerful way to perceive connected transport systems. The article then reviews planning practice at a variety of states worldwide, and suggests a set of focus areas of research or gaps that once filled, the authors expect, will allow further development of connected intercity passenger travel.},

This work is important in measuring the association between target setting and road safety improvement, because such targets are intended to serve as a useful tool to motivate timely road safety measures by the road authorities and others. The estimates to be rectified were based on before-and-after analysis using a comparison group of countries for each country that had set a target. This note first provides a correction to the qualification test for the inclusion of a country in any particular comparison group. It then presents the numerical effects of this correction on the estimates of the effectiveness of setting quantified road safety targets, both in individual countries and across the whole group of countries that set targets in the relevant period. Finally, impacts on the findings of the previous paper are discussed, with the conclusion that the changes in those of the numerical estimates that are affected do not alter the main message of the paper.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

After initial discussion on the nature of spatial data, including the concept of randomness, we focus most of our attention on linear regression models that involve interactions between agents across space. The introduction of spatial variables in to standard linear regression provides a flexible way of characterising these interactions, but complicates both interpretation and estimation of parameters of interest. The estimation of these models leads to three fundamental challenges: the reflection problem, the presence of omitted variables and problems caused by sorting. We consider possible solutions to these problems, with a particular focus on restrictions on the nature of interactions. We show that similar assumptions are implicit in the empirical strategies - fixed effects or spatial differencing - used to address these problems in reduced form estimation. These general lessons carry over to the policy evaluation literature.},

In addition, we also show that spatial fixed effects correctly remove spatial correlation only in the special case where the dependence is group-wise, with all observations in the same group as neighbours of each other.},

The phenomenon of user-generated content and the increased presence of geographic information in such applications have motivated researchers to consider them as a source of geographic information. In this paper we question whether such web applications can serve as reliable sources of spatial content. We differentiate between spatially explicit and implicit applications, in accordance to their declared aims, and evaluate if they have an impact on the spatial distribution of geotagged photos for Great Britain. We also compare the spatial distribution of the photos submitted with population data, and the patterns of contribution to these sources over a period of 18 months. Finally, at a larger scale, we examine the spatial distribution of photos and their spatial density for 15 test areas and look into issues such as data currency and user behaviour. Our findings show that only web applications that urge users to interact directly with spatial entities can serve as reliable, universal sources of spatial content.},

Our research interest is to detect the location where some events are occurring by analyzing only data from weibo information. In this paper, we denote three kind of location for each weibo: (1) content-based location; (2) posting location; (3) registration location of author of weibo. There are two main contributions in our work: (a) detect event-aware location of each weibo; (b) estimate accurate event location based on sets of event-aware locations. In order to detect event-aware location, we model there kinds of location data of each weibo to tackle with detection challenge. After we obtained a set of event-aware locations, we use a hierarchical clustering to estimate the accurate event location. The result showed that our method could improve the accuracy of event location estimation.

  abstract = {Recognizing toponyms and resolving them to their real-world referents is required for providing advanced semantic access to textual data. This process is often hindered by the high degree of variation in toponyms. Candidate selection is the task of identifying the potential entities that can be referred to by a toponym previously recognized. While it has traditionally received little attention in the research community, it has been shown that candidate selection has a significant impact on downstream tasks (i.e. entity resolution), especially in noisy or non-standard text. In this paper, we introduce a flexible deep learning method for candidate selection through toponym matching, using state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We perform an intrinsic toponym matching evaluation based on several new realistic datasets, which cover various challenging scenarios (cross-lingual and regional variations, as well as OCR errors). We report its performance on candidate selection in the context of the downstream task of toponym resolution, both on existing datasets and on a new manually-annotated resource of nineteenth-century English OCR'd text.},

Here we consider the use of social sensing for observing natural hazards. In particular, we present a case study that uses data from a popular social media platform (Twitter) to detect and locate flood events in the UK. In order to improve data quality we apply a number of filters (timezone, simple text filters and a naive Bayes `relevance' filter) to the data. We then use place names in the user profile and message text to infer the location of the tweets. These two steps remove most of the irrelevant tweets and yield orders of magnitude more located tweets than we have by relying on geotagged data. We demonstrate that high resolution social sensing of floods is feasible and we can produce high-quality historical and real-time maps of floods using Twitter.},

This paper presents a new methodology to study social interaction within and between social-geographic regions, and then applies the methodology to a case study of England and Wales. We use a social network, built from geo-located Twitter data, to identify contiguous geographical regions with a shared social identity and then investigate patterns of communication within and between them. In contrast to other approaches (e.g. using phone call data records or online friendship networks), use of Twitter data provides message contents as well as social connections. This allows us to investigate not only the volume of communication between locations, but also the sentiment and vocabulary used in the messages. For example, our case study shows: a significant dialect difference between England and Wales; that regions tend to be more positive about themselves than about others, with the South being more `self-regarding' than the North; and that people talk politics much more between regions than within. This study demonstrates how social media can be used to quantify regional identity and inter-region communications and sentiment, exposing these previously hard-to-observe geographic concepts to analysis.},

  abstract = {Twitter is among the fastest-growing microblogging and online social networking services. Messages posted on Twitter (tweets) have been reporting everything from daily life stories to the latest local and global news and events. Monitoring and analyzing this rich and continuous user-generated content can yield unprecedentedly valuable information, enabling users and organizations to acquire actionable knowledge. This article provides a survey of techniques for event detection from Twitter streams. These techniques aim at finding real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time. In contrast to conventional media, event detection from Twitter streams poses new challenges. Twitter streams contain large amounts of meaningless messages and polluted content, which negatively affect the detection performance. In addition, traditional text mining techniques are not suitable, because of the short length of tweets, the large number of spelling and grammatical errors, and the frequent use of informal and mixed language. Event detection techniques presented in literature address these issues by adapting techniques from various fields to the uniqueness of Twitter. This article classifies these techniques according to the event type, detection task, and detection method and discusses commonly used features. Finally, it highlights the need for public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different detection approaches and various features.},

Laser scanner systems available on the market are presently in a fairly mature state of art while the processing of airborne laser scanner data still is in an early phase of development. To come from irregular 3D point clouds to useful representations and formats for an end-user requires continued research and development of methods and algorithms for interpretation and modelling. This paper presents some methods and algorithms concerning filtering for determining the ground surface, DEM, classification of buildings for 3D City Models and the detection of electrical power lines. The classification algorithms are based on the Minimum Description Length criterion. The use of reflectance data and multiple echoes from the laser scanner is examined and found to be useful in many applications. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The first step employed the IDW method to interpolate LiDAR point data (first and last pulses) to achieve DSM, DTM and DNTM layers (at 1 m resolution). For this interpolation RMSE was 0.19 m. In the second step, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify the LiDAR data into two classes, road and non-road. For this classification, SVM indicated the merged distance layer with intensity data and yielded better identification of the road position. Assessments of the obtained results showed 63\% correctness, 75\% completeness and 52\% quality of classification. In the next step, road edges were defined in the LiDAR-extracted layers, enabling accurate digitizing of the centerline location. More than 95\% of the LiDAR-derived road was digitized within 1.3 m to the field surveyed normal. The proposed approach can provide thorough and accurate road inventory data to support forest management.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

  pages = {56},
  abstract = {We study the relationship between homebuyers' beliefs about future house price changes and their mortgage leverage choices. From a theoretical perspective, whether more pessimistic homebuyers choose more or less leverage is ambiguous and depends on their willingness to reduce the size of their housing investment. When households primarily maximize the levered return of their property investment, more pessimistic homebuyers reduce their leverage to purchase smaller houses. On the other hand, when considerations such as family size pin down the desired property size, pessimistic homebuyers reduce their financial exposure to the housing market by making smaller downpayments to buy similarly-sized homes. To determine which scenario better describes the data, we empirically investigate the cross-sectional relationship between beliefs and leverage choices in the U.S. housing market. Our data combine mortgage financing information and a housing market expectations survey with anonymized social network data from Facebook. The survey shows that an individual's belief distribution about future house price changes is affected by the recent house price experiences of her geographically distant friends, allowing us to use these experiences as quasi-exogenous shifters of individuals' house price beliefs. We find that more pessimistic homebuyers make smaller downpayments and choose higher leverage, in particular in states where default costs are relatively low, as well as during periods when house prices are expected to fall on average. Overall, our results provide evidence for an important role of heterogeneous beliefs in explaining individuals' financial decisionmaking.},

In turn, social networks themselves are associated with geographic proximity, historical ties, political boundaries, and other factors. Traditionally, the unavailability of large-scale and representative data on social connectedness between individuals or geographic regions has posed a challenge for empirical research on social networks. More recently, a body of such research has begun to emerge using data on social connectedness from online social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. To date, most of these research projects have been built on anonymized administrative microdata from Facebook, typically by working with coauthor teams that include Facebook employees. However, there is an inherent limit to the number of researchers that will be able to work with social network data through such collaborations. In this paper, we therefore introduce a new measure of social connectedness at the US county level. Our Social Connectedness Index is based on friendship links on Facebook, the global online social networking service. Specifically, the Social Connectedness Index corresponds to the relative frequency of Facebook friendship links between every county-pair in the United States, and between every US county and every foreign country. Given Facebook's scale as well as the relative representativeness of Facebook's user body, these data provide the first comprehensive measure of friendship networks at a national level.},

  abstract = {The computational representation of place is one of the key research areas for the advancement of geographic information science (GIScience), bridging the gap between place-based human cognition and experience, and space-centered information systems. While many conceptual schemas, vocabularies and ontologies contain some notion of place, the concept is either left implicit or articulated in widely divergent ways. Because of its ubiquity, an ontological clarification of place seems overdue. Adopting the perspective of ontology engineering, and not that of philosophical Ontology, this article paves the way towards the formalization of a place ontology in two steps. First, it provides a critical survey of how this concept is currently represented from lightweight vocabularies to formal ontologies. Second, it presents a set of prolegomena for a place ontology that would overcome the limitations of current approaches. Acknowledging the cultural dependency of place, I argue that such an ontology should be seen as a module positioned between foundational and domain ontologies. This place ontology would provide (i) a conceptual tool to support the modeling of place in any domain, and (ii) a widely applicable ontology, whose deployment would increase the interoperability of datasets, particularly in the context of Linked Data.},

  abstract = {In recent years a web phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has produced large crowdsourced geographic datasets. OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics consists of a set of properties (called `tags') describing geographic classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems, and data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (i) the development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (ii) a study of the cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement) of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic similarity of geographic concepts. Empirical evidence supports the usage of co-citation algorithms {\textendash} SimRank showing the highest plausibility {\textendash} to compute concept similarity in a crowdsourced semantic network.},

In this article, we discuss a notion of geo-semantic relatedness based on Lehrer's semantic fields, and we compare it with geo-semantic similarity. We then describe and validate the Geo Relatedness and Similarity Dataset (GeReSiD), a new open dataset designed to evaluate computational measures of geo-semantic relatedness and similarity. This dataset is larger than existing datasets of this kind, and includes 97 geographic terms combined into 50 term pairs rated by 203 human subjects. GeReSiD is available online and can be used as an evaluation baseline to determine empirically to what degree a given computational model approximates geo-semantic relatedness and similarity.},

  abstract = {Place is a central category in the human experience. Across cultures, individuals describe experiences, express opinions, narrate stories set in and about places. The web provides a large, dynamic corpus of documents describing places from a myriad of viewpoints. Emotions and their expression play an important role in these representations of places, making some places appear joyful and beautiful, and others scary, sad, or even disgusting. In this paper we propose to tap the corpus of place descriptions from the emotional viewpoint, aiming at the development of a framework to model, extract, and analyze emotions relative to places. As first steps in this direction, we focus on place classes, i.e. the types of places that are discussed, such as city, forest, and road. To identify such classes, we design the Place Vocabulary, a linked semantic resource that contains nouns in English that are used to identify natural and built places. Subsequently, we propose a natural language processing technique to extract a multi-dimensional model of place emotion, based on the vocabulary in WordNet-Affect. The technique is applied to a corpus of about 100,000 travel blog posts from travelblog.org, enabling the exploration of the emotional structure of place classes.},

Over the past ten years, Wikimapia has attracted hundreds of thousands of contributors and collected millions of data points, including towns, restaurants, lakes, and tourist attractions (http://wikimapia.org). Unlike OpenStreetMap, Wikimapia adopts a "placial" perspective, favouring rich descriptions over detailed geometries and encouraging the collection of textual and visual content about places with approximate footprints. In this article, we first trace the origin and development of Wikimapia as a for-profit project, intimately linked with search engine advertising. Drawing on an in-depth interview with a former developer, we analyse project's data model and characteristics of its community. As Wikimapia discussions are rife with copyright issues, we discuss the project's intellectual property, as well as its strategies for quality management. Second, we focus on the popularity of the project, which is crucial to the longevity and sustainability of VGI projects. Using behavioural data from Google Trends, we trace a geography of interest in Wikimapia, comparing with that in OpenStreetMap, from a temporal and spatial perspective. While OpenStreetMap attracts more interest in high-income countries, Wikimapia emerges as relatively more popular in low- and middle-income countries, countering the received notion of VGI as a Global North phenomenon.

Content production on online platforms is grounded in the geography of their users and their digital infrastructure. These constraints shape place representation, that is, the amount, quality, and type of digital information available in a geographic area. In this article we study the place representation of user-generated content (UGC) in Los Angeles County, relating the spatial distribution of the data to its geo-demographic context. Adopting a comparative and multi-platform approach, this quantitative analysis investigates the spatial relationship between four diverse UGC datasets and their context at the census tract level (about 685,000 geo-located tweets, 9,700 Wikipedia pages, 4 million OpenStreetMap objects, and 180,000 Foursquare venues). The context includes the ethnicity, age, income, education, and deprivation of residents, as well as public infrastructure. An exploratory spatial analysis and regression-based models indicate that the four UGC platforms possess distinct geographies of place representation. To a moderate extent, the presence of Twitter, OpenStreetMap, and Foursquare data is influenced by population density, ethnicity, education, and income. However, each platform responds to different socio-economic factors and clusters emerge in disparate hotspots. Unexpectedly, Twitter data tend to be located in denser, more deprived areas, and the geography of Wikipedia appears peculiar and harder to explain. These trends are compared with previous findings for the area of Greater London.},

The majority of available gazetteers are stored as relational databases, providing easy access but limiting the complexity of queries. In this paper I create and discuss a conceptual model of a gazetteer using a Neo4J graph database, which allows queries of high complexity to be efficiently run with low response time. A Neo4J graph database is installed onto a Linux server and is populated with a limited dataset to illustrate different aspects of the conceptual model. Queries are written using the generic Neo4J querying language CYPHER. Special focus is given to storing and querying semantic relationships between locations to allow queries about vague spatial relations on different scales. The proposed conceptual model has the potential to solve various state of the art limitations of available gazetteers discussed in this paper, but is accompanied by new limitations needing further attention.},

Each year, new shared tasks and datasets are proposed, ranging from classics like sentiment analysis to irony detection or emoji prediction. Therefore, it is unclear what the current state of the art is, as there is no standardized evaluation protocol, neither a strong set of baselines trained on such domainspecific data. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation framework (TWEETEVAL) consisting of seven heterogeneous Twitter-specific classification tasks. We also provide a strong set of baselines as starting point, and compare different language modeling pre-training strategies. Our initial experiments show the effectiveness of starting off with existing pretrained generic language models, and continue training them on Twitter corpora.},

  abstract = {Green spaces play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological and social systems, a fact recognised in public policy commitments in both the UK and Europe. The amount of provision, the distribution of green space and the ease of access to such spaces are key contributors to social and ecological function in urban environments. We measured distance along the transport network to public green space available to households in Sheffield, and compared this with the distribution of private garden space. In addition, we used a geodemographic database, Mosaic UK, to examine how access to green space varies across different sectors of society. Public green spaces are chronically underprovided relative to recommended targets. For example, 64\% of Sheffield households fail to meet the recommendation of the regulatory agency English Nature (EN), that people should live no further than 300 m from their nearest green space. Moreover, this figure rises to 72\% if we restrict attention to municipal parks recognised by the local council. There is an overall reduction in coverage by green space when moving from neighbourhoods where green space is primarily publicly provided to those where it is privately provided. While access to public green space varies significantly across different social groups, those enjoying the greatest access include more deprived groups and older people. This study highlights the need for additional green space to be created and existing green space to be protected in light of increasing development pressure.},

As communication technologies have improved, however, new forms of place attachment and connections between individuals and places are evolving. We introduce the concept of place elasticity as a new conceptualization of place attachment made possible by innovations in communication and transportation technologies. Place elasticity allows individuals to live in distant locales while maintaining close interaction with a particular place. We explore this concept with questionnaires and interviews from a sample of individuals from rural Appalachian counties in eastern Kentucky. Rural residents of this region have been noted for their strong place attachments and connections to their home county. Based on our questionnaires and interviews from family reunions we propose that place elasticity has three distinct characteristics: portability, strong place bonds, and permanence and that these traits allow individuals to remain connected to home counties and family, thereby allowing migration and settlement in distant locations with minimal loss of connectedness.},

Methods: Cox proportional hazards models. Results: There were large differences in the risk of limiting illness according to occupational social class, with men and women in the least favourable employment conditions nearly four times more likely to become ill than those in the most favourable. Unemployment and economic inactivity also had a powerful effect on illness incidence. Limiting illness was not a permanent state for most participants in the study. Employment status was also related to recovery. Conclusions: Having secure employment in favourable working conditions greatly reduces the risk of healthy people developing limiting illness. Secure employment increases the likelihood of recovery. These findings have considerable implications for both health inequality and economic policies.},

In the identification of spatial relations, roles are combined to generate candidate relations, later verified by a SVM classifier. The Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel is applied, i.e. a convolution kernel that enhances both syntactic and lexical properties of the examples, avoiding the need of a manual feature engineering phase.

We describe the general nature and features of this ontology and show how we have extended it for working particularly with space. Treaitng the semantics of natural language expressions concerning space in this way offers a substantial simplification of the general problem of relating natural spatial language to its contextualized interpretation.

We note that the nature of such terms is highly contested, and suggest that this arises from two main considerations: 1) there are a number of logically distinct categories of place expression, which are not always clearly distinguished in discourse about `place'; 2) the many non-substantive place count nouns (such as `place', `region', `area', etc.) employed in natural language are highly ambiguous. With respect to consideration 1), we propose that place-related expressions should be classified into the following distinct logical types: a) `place-like' count nouns (further subdivided into abstract, spatial and substantive varieties), b) proper names of `place-like' objects, c) locative property phrases, and d) definite descriptions of `place-like' objects. We outline possible formal representations for each of these. To address consideration 2), we examine meanings, connotations and ambiguities of the English vocabulary of abstract and generic place count nouns, and identify underlying elements of meaning, which explain both similarities and differences in the sense and usage of the various terms.},

  abstract = {Problem statement: The way of referring to a place in the geographical space can be formal, based on the spatial coordinates, or informal, which we use in natural language by using toponyms (place names). A toponym can represent several geographical places. This ambiguity made problematic its conversion towards a unique formal representation. Toponym disambiguation in text is the task of assigning a unique location to an ambiguous place name in a given textual context. Approach: Several toponym disambiguation heuristics assumed a geographical proximity between the toponyms of the same context. This proximity can be in terms of spatial distance or in terms of arborsecent relationships, i.e., proximity in the hierarchical tree of the world places. This study presented a new toponym disambiguation heuristic in text based on the quantification of the arborescent proximity between toponyms. This quantification was done by a new measure of geographical correlation that we call the Geographical Density. Results: Our method was compared to the state of the art methods using GeoSemCor corpus and it has outperformed them in term of recall (87.4\%) and coverage (99.0\%). The results showed that the toponyms of the same context are much closer in terms of arborescent relationships than in terms of spatial relationships. Conclusion: We believe that the quantification of arborescent relationships between toponyms of the same textual context is a good way to improve the recall of TD task. However, all the arborescent relationships' types must be considered and not only the meronymy, which is the relation the most exploited in the existing TD methods.},

Following this, we build a collective picture of cognitive place associations in the United Kingdom, linking locations that co-occur in user comments and evaluating the effect of distance on the strength of these associations. Exploring these geographies nationally, associations were shown to be typically weaker over greater distances. This distance decay is also highly regional, rural areas typically have greater levels of distance decay, particularly in Wales and Scotland. When comparing major cities across the UK, we observe distinct distance decay patterns, influenced primarily by proximity to other cities.},

We propose stochastic and robust formulations for the ambulance deployment problem that use data on emergency calls to model uncertainty. By incorporating advances in column and constraint generation, our formulations are solved to exact optimality within minutes. In extensive computational experiments on Washington DC, our approach outperforms previous approaches (i.e. the MEXCLP and MALP) that rely on probabilistic assumptions about the availability of ambulances. Our formulations achieve a reduction of 19 to 28\% in number of shortfalls, requiring only 70\% of the total number of ambulances required in probabilistic models to attain comparable out-of-sample performance.},

  abstract = {Following devolution, differences developed between UK countries in systems of measuring performance against a common target that ambulance services ought to respond to 75\% of calls for what may be immediately life threatening emergencies (category A calls) within 8 minutes. Only in England was this target integral to a ranking system of `star rating', which inflicted reputational damage on services that failed to hit targets, and only in England has this target been met. In other countries, the target has been missed by such large margins that services would have been publicly reported as failing, if they had been covered by the English system of star ratings. The paper argues that this case-study adds to evidence from comparisons of different systems of hospital performance measurement that, to have an effect, these systems need to be designed to inflict reputational damage on those that have performed poorly; and it explores implications of this hypothesis. The paper also asks questions about the adequacy of systems of performance measurement of ambulance services in UK countries.},

The final aim, in response to an informational query of the user, is to return a ranked list of relevant passages in selected documents, allowing text browsing within them. We consider in this paper the spatial component of the texts and the queries. The idea is to perform an off-line linguistic analysis of the document, extracting spatial expressions (i.e. expressions denoting geographical localisations). The point is that such expressions are (in general) much more complex than simple place names. We present a linguistic analyser which recognises them, performing a semantic analysis and computing symbolic representations of their "content". These representations, stored in the text thanks to XML annotation, will act as indexes of passages with which queries are compared. The matching of queries with text expressions is a complex process, needing several kinds of numeric and symbolic computations. A prospective outline of it is described.},

  abstract = {Regular grids or lattices are frequently used to study ecosystems, for observations, experiments and simulations. The regular rectangular or square grid is used more often than the hexagonal grid, but their relative merits have been little discussed. Here we compare rectangular and hexagonal grids for ecological applications. We focus on the reasons some researchers have preferred hexagonal grids and methods to facilitate the use of hexagonal grids. We consider modelling and other applications, including the role of nearest neighbourhood in experimental design, the representation of connectivity in maps, and a new method for performing field surveys using hexagonal grids, which was demonstrated on montane heath vegetation. The rectangular grid is generally preferred because of its symmetrical, orthogonal co-ordinate system and the frequent use of rasters from Geographic Information Systems. Cells in a rectangular grid can also easily be combined to produce new grids with lower resolutions. However, efficient co-ordinate systems and multi-resolution partitions using the hexagonal grid are available. The nearest neighbourhood in a hexagonal grid is simpler and less ambiguous than in a rectangular grid. When nearest neighbourhood, movement paths or connectivity are important, the rectangular grid may not be suitable. We also investigate important differences between visualizations using hexagonal and rectangular grids. A survey of recent uses of grids in Ecological Modelling suggested that hexagonal grids are rarely used, even in applications for which they are more suitable than rectangular grids, e.g. connectivity and movement paths. Researchers should consider their choice of grid at an early stage in project development, and authors should explain the reasons for their choices.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of `grey' literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

These approaches to analysing imagery have antecedents in earlier research on image segmentation and use GIS-like spatial analysis within classification and feature extraction approaches. This article investigates these development and its implications and asks whether or not this is a new paradigm in remote sensing and Geographic Information Science (GIScience). We first discuss several limitations of prevailing per-pixel methods when applied to high resolution images. Then we explore the paradigm concept developed by Kuhn (1962) and discuss whether GEOBIA can be regarded as a paradigm according to this definition. We crystallize core concepts of GEOBIA, including the role of objects, of ontologies and the multiplicity of scales and we discuss how these conceptual developments support important methods in remote sensing such as change detection and accuracy assessment. The ramifications of the different theoretical foundations between the `per-pixel paradigm' and GEOBIA are analysed, as are some of the challenges along this path from pixels, to objects, to geo-intelligence. Based on several paradigm indications as defined by Kuhn and based on an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature we conclude that GEOBIA is a new and evolving paradigm.},

This paper examines the proximate determinants of fertility that are responsible for these variations in fertility. Particular attention is given to the biological and behavioral factors, such as postpartum abstinence, prolonged breastfeeding, and pathological sterility, which are crucial determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa. Using a simple analytic model, the relative fertility-inhibiting effects of the proximate determinants are quantified, and from this analysis an assessment is made of prospects for future trends in fertility. It is concluded that rapid declines in fertility are unlikely to occur in the near future, partly because desired family size is very high and partly because upward pressure on fertility levels will result from the erosion of traditional childspacing practices of postpartum abstinence and prolonged breastfeeding or from declines in levels of pathological sterility in response to public health measures.},

These distinct but related domains collectively provide a framework for addressing culture-place relationships in cities by offering a clear window into the ways that pepole use places as part of their cultural repertoires and how those repertoires can affect a city's social and physical environment.},

This paper proposes an enhanced approximate function. When comparing the proposed function to other approximations studied in the literature, it can be observed that the proposed logistic approximation has a simpler functional form and that it gives higher accuracy, with the maximum error of less than 0.00014 for the entire range. This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the lowest level of error reported in the literature. The proposed logistic approximate function may be appealing to researchers, practitioners and educators given its functional simplicity and mathematical accuracy.},

The study sheds light on how Web 2.0 applications were applied as a tool to transmit information while the disaster was unfolding. This research highlights unique nonprofit cases that inform the role and reliability of Web 2.0 applications during a crisis, and the roles that nonprofit organizations and the general public play while facing a dire emergency. In the cases presented, Web 2.0 applications served as a bridge between first responders, the population in immediate wildfire danger, and the citizens who were trying to help, resulting in saved lives, property, and natural resources. By combining existing literature and collected qualitative data, the researchers argue that Web 2.0 applications represent flexible communication tools for transmission of timely information during a crisis situation.},

Draping, folding, wrinkling, stretching, etc. all convey meaning, and thus each is carefully controlled when filming live actors. When making films with computer simulated cloth, these subtle but important elements must be captured. In this paper we present several methods essential to matching the behavior and look of clothing worn by digital stand-ins to their real world counterparts. Novel contributions include a mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme, a physically correct bending model with (potentially) nonzero rest angles for pre-shaping wrinkles, an interface forecasting technique that promotes the development of detail in contact regions, a post-processing method for treating cloth-character collisions that preserves folds and wrinkles, and a dynamic constraint mechanism that helps to control large scale folding. The common goal of all these techniques is to produce a cloth simulation with many folds and wrinkles improving the realism.},

Their subjective nature, however, and the resulting difficulties in collecting data, means that in many countries there are no officially defined neighbourhoods either in terms of names or boundaries. This has implications not only for policy but also business and social decisions as a whole. With the absence of neighbourhood boundaries many studies resort to using standard administrative units as proxies. Such administrative geographies, however, often have a poor fit with those perceived by residents. Our approach detects these important social boundaries by automatically mining the Web en masse for passively declared neighbourhood data within postal addresses. Focusing on the United Kingdom (UK), this research demonstrates the feasibility of automated extraction of urban neighbourhood names and their subsequent mapping as vague entities. Importantly, and unlike previous work, our process does not require any neighbourhood names to be established a priori.},

In this paper we present and evaluate a method to create deterministic and probabilistic flood maps from Twitter messages that mention locations of flooding. A deterministic flood map created for the December 2015 flood in the city of York (UK) showed good performance (F (2) = 0.69; a statistic ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 expressing a perfect fit with validation data). The probabilistic flood maps we created showed that, in the York case study, the uncertainty in flood extent was mainly induced by errors in the precise locations of flood observations as derived from Twitter data. Errors in the terrain elevation data or in the parameters of the applied algorithm contributed less to flood extent uncertainty. Although these maps tended to overestimate the actual probability of flooding, they gave a reasonable representation of flood extent uncertainty in the area. This study illustrates that inherently uncertain data from social media can be used to derive information about flooding.},

We introduce a five-step methodology based on multi-scale segmentation and object relationship modelling. Hierarchical patch dynamics (HPD) is adopted as the theoretical framework to address issues of heterogeneity, scale, connectivity and quasi-equilibriums in landscapes. Remote sensing has emerged as the most useful data source for characterizing land use/land cover but a vast majority of applications rely on basic image processing concepts developed in the 1970s: one spatial scale, per-pixel classification of a multi-scale spectral feature space. We argue that this methodology does not make sufficient use of spatial concepts of neighbourhood, proximity or homogeneity. In contrast, the authors demonstrate in this article the utility of the HPD framework as a theoretical basis for landscape analysis in two different projects using alternative image processing methodologies, which try to overcome the `pixel-centred' view.},

Many methods have been proposed since now, making use of different resources, techniques and sense inventories. Unfortunately, a gold standard for the evaluation of those methods is not yet available; therefore, it is difficult to verify the performance of such methods. Recently, a georeferenced version of WordNet has been developed, a resource that can be used to compare methods that are based on geographical data with methods that use textual information. In this paper we carry out a comparison between two of these methods. The results show that the knowledge-based method allowed us to obtain better results with a smaller context size. On the other hand, we observed that the map-based method needs a large context to obtain a good accuracy.},

Building on existing literature on territorial stigmatisation that either focuses on macro-scale uses and effects of territorial stigmatisation or micro-scale ethnographic studies of effects, we develop a novel approach that captures the diverse voices that engage in the discourse of denigration by tracing the use of the word and hashtag ``shithole'' on the social media platform Twitter in order to examine who is engaged in the stigmatising discourse, the types of place that are stigmatised and the responses to stigmatised places. Using a robust data set, we highlight two key findings. First, the majority of tweets were aimed at places where the tweeter was not from, a form of othering consistent with how territories are stigmatised by those in positions of power such as policymakers, politicians and journalists. Second, we note that an important and gendered minority of tweets can be characterised by a ``cry for help'' and powerlessness, where the stigma is aimed at their own places. We offer an interpretive lens through which to understand and frame these minoritarian voices by engaging with theories of abjection that allow us to see how minoritarian voices relate to place.},

We employ a longitudinal mobility dataset describing human interactions with Foursquare venues in ten global cities: Chicago, Istanbul, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo. This social media data provides spatio-temporally referenced digital traces left by human use of urban environments, giving us access to the intangible aspects of urban life, such as people behaviours and preferences. Our framework capitalizes on these new data sources, bringing about a novel Geographic Data Science and human-centered methodological approach. Combining network science {\textendash} a study area with great promise for the analysis of cities and their structure {\textendash} with geospatial analysis methods, we model cities as a series of global urban networks. Through a spatially weighted community detection algorithm, we uncover functional neighbourhoods for the ten global cities. Each neighbourhood is linked to hyper-local characterisations of their built environment for the Foursquare venues that compose them, and complemented with a range of measures describing their diversity, morphology and mobility. This information is used in a clustering exercise that uncovers a set of four functional neighbourhood types. Our results enable the profiling and comparison of functional neighbourhoods, based on human dynamics and their contexts, across the sample of global cities. The framework is portable to other geographic contexts where interaction data are available to bind different localities into functional agglomerations, and provide insight into their contextual and human dynamics.},

An unstructured and sparse point cloud is first projected onto the camera image plane and then upsampled to obtain a set of dense 2D images encoding spatial information. Several fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) are then trained to carry out road detection, either by using data from a single sensor, or by using three fusion strategies: early, late, and the newly proposed cross fusion. Whereas in the former two fusion approaches, the integration of multimodal information is carried out at a predefined depth level, the cross fusion FCN is designed to directly learn from data where to integrate information; this is accomplished by using trainable cross connections between the LIDAR and the camera processing branches.},

  abstract = {In case of emergencies (e.g., earthquakes, flooding), rapid responses are needed in order to address victims' requests for help. Social media used around crises involves self-organizing behavior that can produce accurate results, often in advance of official communications. This allows affected population to send tweets or text messages, and hence, make them heard. The ability to classify tweets and text messages automatically, together with the ability to deliver the relevant information to the appropriate personnel are essential for enabling the personnel to timely and efficiently work to address the most urgent needs, and to understand the emergency situation better. In this study, we developed a reusable information technology infrastructure, called Enhanced Messaging for the Emergency Response Sector (EMERSE). The components of EMERSE are: (i) an iPhone application; (ii) a Twitter crawler component; (iii) machine translation; and (iv) automatic message classification. While each component is important in itself and deserves a detailed analysis, in this paper we focused on the automatic classification component, which classifies and aggregates tweets and text messages about the Haiti disaster relief so that they can be easily accessed by non-governmental organizations, relief workers, people in Haiti, and their friends and families.},

Data produced through social networking sites is seen as ubiquitous, rapid and accessible, and it is believed to empower average citizens to become more situationally aware during disasters and coordinate to help themselves. However, with the exponential increase in the volume of social media data, so comes the increase in data that are irrelevant to a disaster, thus, diminishing peoples' ability to find the information that they need in order to organize relief efforts, find help, and potentially save lives. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying informative messages in social media streams during disaster events. Our approach is based on Convolutional Neural Networks and shows significant improvement in performance over models that use the ``bag of words'' and n-grams as features on several datasets of messages from flooding events.},

Participatory mapping has spread like a pandemic with many variants and applications not only in natural resource management but also in many other domains. With mapping as one element, there are now signs of a new pluralist eclecticism and creativity in PMs. The medium and means of mapping, whether ground, paper or GIS and the style and mode of facilitation, influence who takes part, the nature of outcomes and power relationships. Much depends on the behaviour and attitudes of facilitators and who controls the process. Many ethical issues present troubling dilemmas, and lead to overarching questions about empowerment and ownership. Questions to be asked, again and again, are: Who is empowered and who disempowered? And, who gains and who loses?},

Unfortunately, it has been widely documented that large disparities in access to care exist between rural and urban communities. While rural EMS is provided through a variety of resources (e.g. air ambulances, volunteer corps, etc.), in this paper we focus on ground ambulatory care. In particular our goal is to balance the level of first-response ambulatory service provided to patients in urban and rural areas by locating ambulances at appropriate stations. In traditional covering location models the objective is to maximize demand that can be covered; consequently, these models favor locating ambulances in more densely populated areas, resulting in longer response times for patients in more rural areas. To address the issue of fairness in semi-rural/semi-urban communities, we propose three bi-objective covering location models that directly consider fairness via a secondary objective. Results are discussed and compared which provide a menu of alternatives to policy makers.},

  abstract = {The idea that drivers' perceptions of risk affect their decisions and choices, particularly as regards their speed, is at the heart of many years of our education, engineering, and enforcement strategies to improve road safety. Our previous research has shown that horizontal curvature, road width, vertical curvature and separation from on-coming traffic are principal determinants to perceptions of risk on rural roads. The present study examined the relationship between drivers' perceptions of risk and the speeds they choose to drive. Participants drove high definition videos of familiar rural roads in a driving simulator and a smaller group of participants drove the same roads in a university fleet vehicle similar to the one used in the simulator. The results showed that double yellow and wide centreline markings were associated with lower speed choices and higher perceptions of risk, an effect magnified under high traffic conditions. Similarly, in both the simulator and on the roads, driving on narrow roads was associated with significantly lower speeds and increased risk ratings, while wider roads showed a small but significant increase in speeds as compared to standard width control roads. Finally, a range of other road and traffic conditions such as one-lane bridges, level crossings, police cars, and crash area warning signs were also found to be associated with lower speed choices and higher risk perceptions.},

  abstract = {The subjective categories that drivers use to distinguish between different road types have been shown to influence the speeds they choose to drive but as yet we do not understand the road features that drivers use to make their discriminations. To better understand how drivers describe and categorise the roads they drive, 55 participants were recruited to drive a video of familiar urban roads in a driving simulator at the speed they would drive these roads in their own cars (using the accelerator and brake pedal in the driving simulator to adjust their speed). The participants were then asked to sort photos of the roads they had just driven into piles so that their driving would be the same on all roads in one pile but different to the other piles. Finally, they answered a series of questions about each road to indicate what speed they would drive, the safe speed for the road, their speed limit belief as well as providing ratings of comfort, difficulty and familiarity. Overall, drivers' categorisation of roads was informed by a number of factors including speed limit belief, road features and markings (including medians), road width, and presence of houses, driveways and footpaths. The participants' categories were congruent with what they thought the speed limits were, but not necessarily the actual speed limits. Mismatches between actual speed limits and speed limit beliefs appeared to result from category-level expectations about speed limits that took precedence over recent experience in the simulator. Roads that historically had a 50 km/h speed limit but had been reduced to 40 km/h were still regarded as 50 km/h roads by the participants, underscoring the point that simply posting a sign with a lower speed limit is not enough to overcome drivers' expectations and habits associated with the visual appearance of a road. The findings provided insights into how drivers view and categorise roads, and identify specific areas that could be used to improve speed limit credibility.},

  abstract = {The potential for using road markings to indicate speed limits was investigated in a driving simulator over the course of two sessions. Two types of experimental road markings, an ``Attentional'' set designed to provide visually distinct cues to indicate speed limits of 60, 80 and 100 km/h, and a ``Perceptual'' set designed to also affect drivers' perception of speed, were compared to a standard undifferentiated set of markings. Participants (n = 20 per group) were assigned to one of four experimental groups (Attentional-Explicit, Attentional-Implicit, Perceptual-Explicit, Perceptual-Implicit) or a Control group (n = 22; standard road markings). The Explicit groups were instructed about the meaning of the road markings while those in the Implicit and Control groups did not receive any explanation. Participants drove five 10 km simulated roads containing three speed zones (60, 80 and 100 km/h) during the first session. The participants returned to the laboratory approximately 3 days later to drive five more trials including roads they had not seen before, a trial that included a secondary task, and a trial where speed signs were removed and only markings were present. The findings indicated that both types of road markings improved drivers' compliance with speed limits compared to the control group, but that explicit instruction as to the meaning of the markings was needed to realise their full benefit. Although previous research has indicated the benefit of road markings used as warnings to indicate speed reductions in advance of horizontal or vertical curves, the findings of the present experiment also suggest that systematically associating road markings with specific speed limits may be a useful way to improve speed limit compliance and increase speed homogeneity.},

The challenge in automated generalisation of road networks is to derive a connected network while maintaining the structure for the intended target scale and to achieve this with minimum user intervention. A lot of methods to select, displace and simplify roads have been presented; the focus here is on the generalisation of networks using visual perception techniques. This paper presents a framework based on visual perception that uses minimum attributes for generalisation of both `rural' and `urban' roads over large scale change. The system incorporated graph theoretic techniques to explicitly model the topology of the network as it was generalized. The model uses a fine scale map (1:1250 or 1:2500) as input and generates small scale (1:250,000) maps directly from it without creating intermediate small scale maps. The results compared favorably with paper maps (Ordnance Surveys Stratgie dataset (1:250,000)).},

Data from such uninstrumented environments can provide valuable knowledge to inform student learning. Analyzing such data, however, can be challenging. The complexity of students' experiences reflected from social media content requires human interpretation. However, the growing scale of data demands automatic data analysis techniques. In this paper, we developed a workflow to integrate both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. We focused on engineering students' Twitter posts to understand issues and problems in their educational experiences. We first conducted a qualitative analysis on samples taken from about 25,000 tweets related to engineering students' college life. We found engineering students encounter problems such as heavy study load, lack of social engagement, and sleep deprivation. Based on these results, we implemented a multi-label classification algorithm to classify tweets reflecting students' problems. We then used the algorithm to train a detector of student problems from about 35,000 tweets streamed at the geo-location of Purdue University. This work, for the first time, presents a methodology and results that show how informal social media data can provide insights into students' experiences.},

Traditional sources of social data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information on the city alone does not capture how the population values different parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional insights. We use a special type of VGI{\textemdash}metadata from geotagged Flickr images{\textemdash}to identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications with noise and the `{$\alpha$}-shape' algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs in Inner London for a period 2013{\textendash}2015 and develop an innovative visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored. Our results expand and improve upon the previous literature on this topic and provide a useful reference for urban practitioners who might wish to include more timely information when making decisions.},

  abstract = {Social sensing is an analytical method to study the interaction between human and space through extracting reliable information from massive volunteered information data. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are a large number of Internet social sensing data. However, most of them lack geographic attribute. In order to resolve this problem, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network geographic classification model based on keyword extraction and synonym substitution (KE-CNN) which could determine the geographic attribute by extracting the semantic features from text data. Besides, we realizes the non-contact pandemic social sensing and construct the co-word complex network by capturing the spatiotemporal behaviour of a large number of people. Our research found that (1) mining co-word network can obtain most public opinion information of pandemic events, (2) KE-CNN model improves the accuracy by 5\%{\textendash}15\% compared with the traditional machine learning method. Through this method, we could effectively establish medical, catering, railway station, education and other types of text feature set, supplement the missing spatial data tags, and achieve a good geographical seamless social sensing.},

By augmenting the massive human-powered sensing capabilities of Twitter and related microblogging services with content-derived location information, this framework can overcome the sparsity of geoenabled features in these services and enable new locationbased personalized information services, the targeting of regional advertisements, and so on. Three of the key features of the proposed approach are: (i) its reliance purely on tweet content, meaning no need for user IP information, private login information, or external knowledge bases; (ii) a classification component for automatically identifying words in tweets with a strong local geo-scope; and (iii) a lattice-based neighborhood smoothing model for refining a user's location estimate. The system estimates k possible locations for each user in descending order of confidence. On average we find that the location estimates converge quickly (needing just 100s of tweets), placing 51\% of Twitter users within 100 miles of their actual location.},

Modern authors often contrast silence with anthropogenic sounds, while historical authors adhere to a cultural construction where the Lake District is presented as a tranquil area by ignoring industrial sounds. Using sentiment analysis we show that silence and tranquil sounds in our corpora are, as a whole, more positively associated than random text from the corpora, with this difference being especially marked in contemporary descriptions. Focusing closely on individual texts allows us to illustrate how this increased positivity can be related to the emergence of silence and tranquillity as valuable components of landscape. Mapping our corpora confirmed the influence of Wordsworth's writing on descriptions of silence; and revealed the co-location of pockets of tranquillity near to transport arteries in contemporary descriptions.},

The results suggest that social media data can be a valuable source for capturing vernacular geography from which vernacular neighbourhoods could be delimited. The study also revealed factors which may have contributed to vernacular neighbourhood demarcation. Twitter data was seen to both mirror the physical form of the underlying topography and reflect the social character of the city's land use. This work builds upon previous attempts to investigate vernacular geography which used more traditional methods, such as sketch maps and interviews. It also examines how manual qualitative coding can improve data quality and demonstrates how R statistical software can be used to capture, analyse and present geospatial data.},

Traditionally, intensity information has not been used in feature extraction from LIDAR data because the data is too noisy. This article deals with using as much of the recorded laser information as possible thus both height and intensity are used. To extract roads from a LIDAR point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the LIDAR points progressively into road or non-road. Initially, an accurate digital terrain model (DTM) model is created by using successive morphological openings with different structural element sizes. Individual laser points are checked for both a valid intensity range and height difference from the subsequent DTM. A series of filters are then passed over the road candidate image to improve the accuracy of the classification. The success rate of road detection and the level of detail of the resulting road image both depend on the resolution of the laser scanner data and the types of roads expected to be found. The presence of road-like features within the survey area such as private roads and car parks is discussed and methods to remove this information are entertained. All algorithms used are described and applied to an example urban test site.},

To extract roads from a lidar point cloud, a hierarchical classification technique is used to classify the lidar points progressively into road and non-road points. During the classification process, both intensity and height values are initially used. Due to the homogeneous and consistent nature of roads, a local point density is introduced to finalize the classification. The resultant binary classification is then vectorized by convolving a complex-valued disk named the Phase Coded Disk (PCD) with the image to provide three separate pieces of information about the road. The centerline and width of the road are obtained from the resultant magnitude image while the direction is determined from the corresponding phase image, thus completing the vectorized road model. All algorithms used are described and applied to two urban test sites. Completeness values of 0.88 and 0.79 and correctness values of 0.67 and 0.80 were achieved for the classification phase of the process. The vectorization of the classified results yielded RMS values of 1.56 m and 1.66 m, completeness values of 0.84 and 0.81 and correctness values of 0.75 and 0.80 for two different data sets.},

  abstract = {Crashes on rural roads are a major road safety problem, accounting for up to twothirds of deaths and serious injuries worldwide. Rural intersections, in particular, are dangerous locations, accounting for over 30 percent of these rural crashes. Most collisions at intersections occur in high-speed settings, at intersections that are uncontrolled or controlled by stop or give-way signs, and often on low-volume, single-carriageway roads. This paper provides an overview of a systematic review of international literature, identifies `best-practice' measures to reduce crash and injury risk at rural intersections and describes cutting-edge strategies and evaluation of infrastructure measures for managing safety at rural intersections. Cost-effective measures include: measures to reduce speed and speeding and the injury consequences, speed perception measures, roundabouts, traffic signals, gradeseparation, channelisation, signing to clarify priority, removal of sight distance obstructions, provision of medians, skid-resistant pavements and limited access from side roads and driveways. The paper highlights the need to address key crash problems at rural intersections by developing and implementing a system-wide and comprehensive approach that fundamentally improves the operation and design of these locations.},

The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remote sensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated image understanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automatic geolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads and intersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literature that could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data is not available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from the detection of roads and intersections, to the identification of the enclosing geographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learned manually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between the detected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset with aerial images of two European cities and use the publicly available OpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show in extensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizations in the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on the other and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also show that the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotations can be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detection results.},

To address this difficulty, we introduce a clustering model and research methodology for studying the structure and composition of a city on a large scale based on the social media its residents generate. We apply this new methodology to data from approximately 18 million check-ins collected from users of a location-based online social network. Unlike the boundaries of traditional municipal organizational units such as neighborhoods, which do not always reflect the character of life in these areas, our clusters, which we call Livehoods, are representations of the dynamic areas that comprise the city. We take a qualitative approach to validating these clusters, interviewing 27 residents of Pittsburgh, PA, to see how their perceptions of the city project onto our findings there. Our results provide strong support for the discovered clusters, showing how Livehoods reveal the distinctly characterized areas of the city and the forces that shape them.},

Instead of relying on a static, pre-computed road appearance model, this method adjusts its model to changing environments. It achieves robustness by combining sensor information from a laser range finder, a pose estimation system and a color camera. Using the first two modalities, the system first identifies a nearby patch of drivable surface. Computer Vision then takes this patch and uses it to construct appearance models to find drivable surface outward into the far range. This information is put into a drivability map for the vehicle path planner. In addition to evaluating the method's performance using a scoring framework run on real-world data, the system was entered, and won, the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Post-race log-file analysis proved that without the Computer Vision algorithm, the vehicle would not have driven fast enough to win.},

Supporting it requires a representation scheme that can capture spatial phenomena encountered in language as well as in images and videos. Existing spatial representations are not sufficient for describing spatial configurations used in complex tasks. This paper extends the capabilities of existing spatial representation languages and increases coverage of the semantic aspects that are needed to ground spatial meaning of natural language text in the world. Our spatial relation language is able to represent a large, comprehensive set of spatial concepts crucial for reasoning and is designed to support composition of static and dynamic spatial configurations. We integrate this language with the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotation schema and present a corpus annotated by this extended AMR. To exhibit the applicability of our representation scheme, we annotate text taken from diverse datasets and show how we extend the capabilities of existing spatial representation languages with fine-grained decomposition of semantics and blend it seamlessly with AMRs of sentences and discourse representations as a whole.},

While a great deal of attention is on the individual as an `aggressor,' the banning of entire Reddit subcommunities (i.e., subreddits) demonstrates that this is a multi-layer concern. Existing research on inter-community conflict has largely focused on specific subcommunities or ideological opponents. However, antagonistic behaviors may be more pervasive and integrate into the broader network. In this work, we study the landscape of conflicts among subreddits by deriving higher-level (community) behaviors from the way individuals are sanctioned and rewarded. By constructing a conflict network, we characterize different patterns in subreddit-to-subreddit conflicts as well as communities of `co-targeted' subreddits .The dynamics of these interactions also reveals a shift in conflict focus over time.},

Recently, social media platforms, especially Twitter, have gained traction as a novel source of information on disaster events. Unfortunately, geographical information is rarely attached to tweets, which hinders the use of Twitter for geographical applications. As a solution, geoparsing algorithms extract and can locate geographical locations referenced in a tweet's text. This paper describes TAGGS, a new algorithm that enhances location disambiguation by employing both metadata and the contextual spatial information of groups of tweets referencing the same location regarding a specific disaster type. Validation demonstrated that TAGGS approximately attains a recall of 0.82 and precision of 0.91. Without lowering precision, this roughly doubles the number of correctly found administrative subdivisions and cities, towns, and villages as compared to individual geoparsing. We applied TAGGS to 55.1 million flood-related tweets in 12 languages, collected over 3 years. We found 19.2 million tweets mentioning one or more flood locations, which can be towns (11.2 million), administrative subdivisions (5.1 million), or countries (4.6 million). In the future, TAGGS could form the basis for a global event detection system.},

Inclusion of contextual hydrological information could improve the perfor\- mance of such algorithms. Here, a multilingual multimodal neural network is designed that can effectively use both textual and hydrological information. The classification data was obtained from Twitter using flood-related keywords in English, French, Spanish and Indonesian. Subsequently, hydrological information was extracted from a global precipitation dataset based on the tweet's timestamp and locations mentioned in its text. Three experiments were performed analyzing precision, recall and F1-scores while comparing a neural network that uses hydrological information against a neural network that does not. Results showed that F1-scores improved significantly across all experiments. Most notably, when optimizing for precision the neural network with hy\- drological information could achieve a precision of 0.91 while the neural network without hydrological infor\- mation failed to effectively optimize. Moreover, this study shows that including hydrological information can assist in the translation of the classification algorithm to unseen languages.},

A checklist, derived from the methodological literature on multilevel modeling and focusing on the issues of model development and specification, data considerations, estimation, and inference, was used to analyze the articles. The most common applications were two-level models where individuals were nested within contexts. Most studies were nonexperimental and used nonprobability samples. The amount of data at each level varied widely across studies, as did the number of models examined. Analyses of reporting practices indicated some clear problems, with many articles not reporting enough information for a reader to critique the reported analyses. For example, in many articles, one could not determine how many models were estimated, what covariance structure was assumed, what type of centering if any was used, whether the data were consistent with assumptions, whether outliers were present, or how the models were estimated. Guidelines for researchers reporting multilevel analyses are provided.},

Thus, it is particularly important to work with the semantics of such queries, both by understanding the terminology and by recognizing geographic references in natural language text. In this paper, we explore the use of natural language expressions, which we call positioning expressions, to perform geographic searches on the Web, without resorting to geocoded data or gazetteers. Such positioning expressions denote the location of a subject of interest with respect to a landmark. Our approach leads to a query expansion technique that can be explored by virtually any keyword-based search engine. Results obtained in our experiments show an expressive improvement over the traditional keyword-based search and a potential path for tackling many kinds of common geographic queries.},

  abstract = {Toponym resolution, or grounding names of places to their actual locations, is an important problem in analysis of both historical corpora and present-day news and web content. Recent approaches have shifted from rule-based spatial minimization methods to machine learned classifiers that use features of the text surrounding a toponym. Such methods have been shown to be highly effective, but they crucially rely on gazetteers and are unable to handle unknown place names or locations. We address this limitation by modeling the geographic distributions of words over the earth's surface: we calculate the geographic profile of each word based on local spatial statistics over a set of geo-referenced language models. These geo-profiles can be further refined by combining in-domain data with background statistics from Wikipedia. Our resolver computes the overlap of all geo-profiles in a given text span; without using a gazetteer, it performs on par with existing classifiers. When combined with a gazetteer, it achieves state-of-the-art performance for two standard toponym resolution corpora (TR-CoNLL and Civil War). Furthermore, it dramatically improves recall when toponyms are identified by named entity recognizers, which often (correctly) find non-standard variants of toponyms.},

This paper poses the question as to why part of the discipline turned its back on public policy and particularly issues of poverty and inequality. The aim of the paper is to encourage students and advocates of geography to think a little about what they are involved in (and to think about the role of academia more generally). Recent publications in a number of geography journals have revealed much angst among prominent geographers concerning the state of human geography and, in particular, its links to contemporary policy debate. However, while geographers discuss the debate, we argue that they are not a significant part of it. We take a critical turn and look at the debate that two geographers {\textendash} Ron Martin and Doreen Massey {\textendash} have raised within the light of wider debates on public policy, politics, quantification, academia and the policy agenda. We conclude that for many reasons there is unlikely to be a large shift towards policy-orientated research within human geography.},

Existing visual text analysis systems have provided temporal views of changes based on topical themes extracted from text data. But few have associated topical themes with events that cause the changes. In this paper, we propose an interactive visual analytics system, LeadLine, to automatically identify meaningful events in news and social media data and support exploration of the events. To characterize events, LeadLine integrates topic modeling, event detection, and named entity recognition techniques to automatically extract information regarding the investigative 4 Ws: who, what, when, and where for each event. To further support analysis of the text corpora through events, LeadLine allows users to interactively examine meaningful events using the 4 Ws to develop an understanding of how and why. Through representing large-scale text corpora in the form of meaningful events, LeadLine provides a concise summary of the corpora. LeadLine also supports the construction of simple narratives through the exploration of events. To demonstrate the efficacy of LeadLine in identifying events and supporting exploration, two case studies were conducted using news and social media data.},

The tool detects the number of layers added to a project and segments them iteratively with a multiresolution segmentation algorithm in a bottom-up approach, where the scale factor in the segmentation, namely, the scale parameter (SP), increases with a constant increment. The average LV value of the objects in all of the layers is computed and serves as a condition for stopping the iterations: when a scale level records an LV value that is equal to or lower than the previous value, the iteration ends, and the objects segmented in the previous level are retained. Three orders of magnitude of SP lags produce a corresponding number of scale levels. Tests on very high resolution imagery provided satisfactory results for generic applicability. The tool has a significant potential for enabling objectivity and automation of GEOBIA analysis.},

Based on this discussion, we propose a simple practical protocol for statistical significance test selection in NLP setups and accompany this protocol with a brief survey of the most relevant tests. We then survey recent empirical papers published in ACL and TACL during 2017 and show that while our community assigns great value to experimental results, statistical significance testing is often ignored or misused.

  abstract = {The exponential growth of natural language text data in social media has contributed a rich data source for geographic information. However, incorporating such data source for GIS analysis faces tremendous challenges as existing GIS data tend to be geometry based while natural language text data tend to rely on natural language spatial relation (NLSR) terms. To alleviate this problem, one critical step is to translate geometric configurations into NLSR terms, but existing methods to date (e.g. mean value or decision tree algorithm) are insufficient to obtain a precise translation. This study addresses this issue by adopting the random forest (RF) algorithm to automatically learn a robust mapping model from a large number of samples and to evaluate the importance of each variable for each NLSR term. Because the semantic similarity of the collected terms reduces the classification accuracy, different grouping schemes of NLSR terms are used, with their influences on classification results being evaluated. The experiment results demonstrate that the learned model can accurately transform geometric configurations into NLSR terms, and that recognizing different groups of terms require different sets of variables. More importantly, the results of variable importance evaluation indicate that the importance of topology types determined by the 9-intersection model is weaker than metric variables in defining NLSR terms, which contrasts to the assertion of `topology matters, metric refines' in existing studies.},

  abstract = {Events are a core concept of spatial information, but locationbased social media (LBSM) provide information on reactions to events. Individuals have varied degrees of agency in initiating, reacting to or modifying the course of events, and reactions include observations of occurrence, expressions containing sentiment or emotions, or a call to action. Key characteristics of reactions include referent events and information about who reacted, when, where and how. Collective reactions are composed of multiple individual reactions sharing common referents. They can be characterized according to the following dimensions: spatial, temporal, social, thematic and interlinkage. We present a conceptual framework, which allows characterization and comparison of collective reactions. For a thematically well-defined class of event such as storms, we can explore differences and similarities in collective attribution of meaning across space and time. Other events may have very complex spatio-temporal signatures (e.g. political processes such as Brexit or elections), which can be decomposed into series of individual events (e.g. a temporal window around the result of a vote). The purpose of our framework is to explore ways in which collective reactions to events in LBSM can be described and underpin the development of methods for analysing and understanding collective reactions to events.},

Overall classification accuracies between pixelbased and object-based classifications were not statistically significant (p {$>$} 0.05) when the same machine learning algorithms were applied. Using object-based image analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between maps produced using the DT algorithm compared to maps produced using either RF (p = 0.0116) or SVM algorithms (p = 0.0067). Using pixel-based image analysis, there was no statistically significant difference (p {$>$} 0.05) between results produced using different classification algorithms. Classifications based on RF and SVM algorithms provided a more visually adequate depiction of wetland, riparian, and crop land cover types when compared to DT based classifications, using either object-based or pixel-based image analysis. In this study, pixel-based classifications utilized fewer variables (15 vs. 300), achieved similar classification accuracies, and required less time to produce than object-based classifications. Object-based classifications produced a visually appealing generalized appearance of land cover classes. Based exclusively on overall accuracy reports, there was no advantage to preferring one image analysis approach over another for the purposes of mapping broad land cover types in agricultural environments using medium spatial resolution earth observation imagery.},

We investigate one particular type of location description, fictive motion (as in, The range runs along the coast). The use of this structure is known to highlight particular properties of the described entity, as well as to convey its configuration in physical space in an effective way. We annotated 496 fictive motion structures in seven corpora that represent different types of spatial discourse {\textendash} news, travel blogs, texts describing outdoor pursuits and local history, as well as image and location descriptions. We analysed the results not only by examining the distribution of fictive motion structures across corpora, but also by exploring and comparing the semantic categories of verbs used in fictive motion. Our findings, first, add to our knowledge of location description strategies that go beyond prototypical locative phrases. They further reveal how the use of fictive motion varies across types of spatial discourse and reflects the nature of the described environment. Methodologically, we highlight the benefits of a cross-corpora analysis in the study of spatial language use across a variety of contexts.},

  abstract = {Mapping or ``delimiting'' landforms is one of geomorphology's primary tools. Computer-based techniques such as land-surface segmentation allow the emulation of the process of manual landform delineation. Land-surface segmentation exhaustively subdivides a digital elevation model (DEM) into morphometrically-homogeneous irregularly-shaped regions, called terrain segments. Terrain segments can be created from various land-surface parameters (LSP) at multiple scales, and may therefore potentially correspond to the spatial extents of landforms such as drumlins. However, this depends on the segmentation algorithm, the parameterization, and the LSPs. In the present study we assess the widely used multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm for its potential in providing terrain segments which delimit drumlins. Supervised testing was based on five 5-m DEMs that represented a set of 173 synthetic drumlins at random but representative positions in the same landscape. Five LSPs were tested, and four variants were computed for each LSP to assess the impact of median filtering of DEMs, and logarithmic transformation of LSPs. The testing scheme (1) employs MRS to partition each LSP exhaustively into 200 coarser scales of terrain segments by increasing the scale parameter (SP), (2) identifies the spatially best matching terrain segment for each reference drumlin, and (3) computes four segmentation accuracy metrics for quantifying the overall spatial match between drumlin segments and reference drumlins. Results of 100 tests showed that MRS tends to perform best on LSPs that are regionally derived from filtered DEMs, and then logtransformed. MRS delineated 97\% of the detected drumlins at SP values between 1 and 50. Drumlin delimitation rates with values up to 50\% are in line with the success of manual interpretations. Synthetic DEMs are well-suited for assessing landform quantification methods such as MRS, since subjectivity in the reference data is avoided which increases the reliability, validity and applicability of results.},

We investigate these changes by statistical analysis of a dataset comprising 107 million Twitter messages (authored by 2.7 million unique user accounts). Using a latent vector autoregressive model to aggregate across thousands of words, we identify high-level patterns in diffusion of linguistic change over the United States. Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population size. However, demographic similarity {\textendash} especially with regard to race {\textendash} plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather than moving towards a single unified ``netspeak'' dialect, language evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault lines in spoken American English.},

Anisotropic operations have the potential to discriminate between orientated and non-orientated objects. The techniques have been applied to data sets from different laser scanning systems and from different regions, mainly focussing on high-density laser scanner data. The results achieved in these pilot studies show the large potential of airborne laser scanning in the field of 3-D GIS data acquisition.},

  abstract = {Most people do not use a formal geographical vocabulary, however they do use a wide variety of geographical terms on a daily basis. Identifiers such as 'Downtown' are components of a vernacular geography which is vastly more used than the coordinates and scientifically defined variables beloved of most professional analysts. Terms like these build into the jointly defined world-views within which we all act. Despite its importance for policymaking and quality of life, attention is rarely paid to this vernacular geography because it is hard to capture and use. This paper presents tools for capturing this geography, an example of the tools' use to define 'High Crime' areas, and an initial discussion of the issues surrounding vernacular data. While the problems involved in analysing such data are not to be underestimated, such a system aims to pull together professional and popular geographical understanding, to the advantage of both.},

  abstract = {Lidar is an efficient tool for remotely monitoring targets or objects, but the effective range is often limited by signalto-noise ratio (SNR). The reason is that noises or interferences always badly affect the measured results. So, to detect the weak signals buried in noises is a fundamental and important problem in the Lidar systems. It has been found that digital filters are not suitable for processing Lidar signals in noises, while the wavelet transform is an efficient tool for signal analysis in time{\textendash}frequency domain that is very sensitive to the transient signals. In this paper, we propose a new method of the Lidar signal acquisition based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This method can significantly improve the SNR so that the effective measured range of Lidar is increased. The performance for our method is investigated by detecting the simulating and real Lidar signals in white noise. To contrast, the results of Butterworth filter, which is a kind of finite impulse response (FIR) filter, are also demonstrated. Finally, the experimental results show that our approach outperforms the traditional methods.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of urban spatial structure on the opportunities for people to participate in face-to-face activities. We make use of the Social Interaction Potential (SIP) metric, a tool to measure the average level of opportunity for people to engage in face-to-face activities given some basic constraints on their daily mobility patterns. Generally, this opportunity is a reflection of whether the urban spatial structure {\textendash} a term that broadly applies to the spatial arrangement of land-uses and the interactions between them {\textendash} constrains or permits the ability for potential activity partners to be at the same place and time. In this paper, the SIP metric is applied to 42 metropolitan regions in the United States with populations over 1,000,000 people. These measurements are regressed against a set of indicators of urban sprawl to expose the relationship between spatial structure and SIP. The indicators are generated by a factor analysis of a large set of variables describing the scale, centrality and dispersion of land-uses in addition to several other structural and infrastructure-related variables. Cluster analysis is also used to organize the regions into similar groupings with respect to their structural characteristics and the level of SIP they provide. The findings indicate that social interaction potential is hampered by decentralization, fragmentation, and longer commutes in the largest metropolitan regions in the country. Interestingly, the negative effect of decentralization on SIP Efficiency is found to be nearly ten times stronger than that of fragmentation and nearly 20 times stronger than the effect of mean commuting duration.},

  abstract = {Due mainly to increasing difficulties in recruiting and retaining health professionals to work in remote and peripheral areas of Scotland, there is discussion of the need to implement new models of primary health care provision. However, innovative service models may imply a reduction in the number of health professionals who live and work in remote communities. Currently decisions about remodelling service provision are being taken by National Health Service stakeholders, apparently with little consideration of the wider social and economic impacts of change. This paper aims to argue that health professionals contribute to the fabric of rural life in a number of ways and that decisions about health service redesign need to take this into account. As well as fulfilling a wide health and social care role for patients, the authors seek to show that health professionals are important to the social sustainability of rural communities as, due to their unique position, they are often at the heart of networks within and between communities. The wider economic contribution of health services in remote communities is important, but often underplayed. The authors propose that theories of capital, principally the concept of social capital, could help in investigating the wider contribution of health professionals to their local communities. Ultimately, it is proposed that health services, as embodied in nurses, doctors and others, could be highly important to the ongoing livelihood and social infrastructure of fragile remote communities. Since this area is poorly understood, there is a need for prospective primary research and evaluation of service redesign initiatives.},

In particular, the rapid development of deep learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing in recent years has allowed more information related to natural disasters to be extracted from social media, such as the severity of building damage and flood water levels. Meanwhile, many recent studies have integrated information extracted from social media with that from other sources, such as remote sensing and sensor networks, to provide comprehensive and detailed information on natural disasters. Therefore, it is of great significance to review the existing work, given the rapid development of this field. In this review, we summarized eight common tasks and their solutions in social media content analysis for natural disasters. We also grouped and analyzed studies that make further use of this extracted information, either standalone or in combination with other sources. Based on the review, we identified and discussed challenges and opportunities.},

The most distinctive elements in the urban landscape - categorised in paths, nodes, edges, districts and landmarks - give shape to individuals' mental representation of the city. Lynch's approach has stimulated research into spatial cognition, urban design and artificial intelligence, and it still represents an essential pillar in the analysis of urban dynamics. Nevertheless, an explicit link between The Image of the City and GIScience has not been completely explored yet. In this paper, a computational approach to The Image of the City is proposed. Different perspectives in spatial cognition and GIS research are integrated to obtain a complete Image of the City, in which the most salient elements are shared by a large part of citizens. Nodes, paths and districts were identified through network science techniques. Methods drawn from the information approach to The Image of the City are used to detect landmarks, integrating the complexity of points of reference in their visual, structural and semantic components, as conceptualised by Lynch and successive research. The methods were applied to the central area of Boston and built using freely available spatial datasets. Results were compared to Lynch's maps to evaluate the methodology: besides a considerable discrepancy with regard to landmarks, a good correspondence for paths, nodes, edges and districts was found.},

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9\% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks.},

Prominent among these are the naming of upland features such as mountains, but mountains are an enigmatic phenomenon which do not bear precise and repeatable definition.

We take a specifically multi-resolution approach to the definition of the fuzzy set membership of morphometric classes of landscape. We explore this idea with respect to the identification of culturally recognized landscape features of the English Lake District. Discussion focuses on peaks and passes, and the results show that the landscape elements identified in the analysis correspond to well-known landmarks included in a place name database for the area, although many more are found in the analysis than are named in the available database. Further analysis shows that a richer interrogation of the landscape can be achieved with Geographical Information Systems when using this method than using standard approaches.},

Further contextual effects were shown by significant random variability in the slopes of the relation between mental health and economic inactivity at the electoral division level. Our results suggest that the places in which people live affect their mental health, supporting NHS policy that multi-agency planning to reduce inequalities in mental health status should address the wider determinants of health, as well as services for individual patients.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the increasing belief that the places where people live influence their health, there is surprisingly little consistent evidence for their associations with mental health. We investigated the joint effect of community and individual-level socio-economic deprivation and social cohesion on individual mental health status. Methods Multilevel analysis of population survey data on 10 653 adults aged 18{\textendash}74 years nested within the 325 census enumeration districts in Caerphilly county borough, Wales, UK. The outcome measure was the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) subscale of the SF-36 instrument. A social cohesion subscale was derived from a factor analysis of responses to the Neighbourhood Cohesion scale and was modelled at individual and area level. Area income deprivation was measured by the percentage of low income households. Results Poor mental health was significantly associated with area-level income deprivation and low social cohesion after adjusting for individual risk factors. High social cohesion significantly modified the association between income deprivation and mental health: the difference between the predicted mean area mental health scores at the 10th and 90th centiles of the low income distribution was 3.7 in the low cohesion group and 0.9 in the high cohesion group (difference of the difference in means {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.8, 95\% CI: 0.2, 5.4). Conclusions Income deprivation and social cohesion measured at community level are potentially important joint determinants of mental health. Further research on the impact of the social environment on mental health should investigate causal pathways in a longitudinal study.},

We focused on the hazards with the greatest impacts{\textemdash}heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods, and windstorms{\textemdash}and evaluated their spatial and temporal variations in intensity and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic dynamics through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of human exposure under a corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes on the basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during the reference period and assumed it to be static under a scenario of no adaptation.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We found that weather-related disasters could affect about two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 (351 million people exposed per year [uncertainty range 126 million to 523 million] during the period 2071{\textendash}100) compared with 5\% during the reference period (1981{\textendash}2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About 50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the year 2100 (152 000 deaths [80 500{\textendash}239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal gradient, increasing towards southern Europe, where the premature mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per million inhabitants [482{\textendash}957] during the period 2071{\textendash}100 \emph{vs} 11 during the reference period) could become the greatest environmental risk factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming (accounting for more than 90\% of the rise in risk to human beings), mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700 heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period \emph{vs} 151 500 [80 100{\textendash}239 000] during the period 2071{\textendash}100).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken.

In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning.},

Religion is important in the life of one-half of US women, whereas not even for one of six Europeans. By every available measure, American women are more religious than European women. Catholic and Protestant women have notably higher fertility than those not belonging to any denomination in the US and across Europe. In all European regions and in the United States as well as among all denominations the more devout have more children. However, women in Northern and Western Europe who are the least religious have equivalent or even higher fertility than women in the US, and notably higher fertility than those in Southern Europe. This suggests that forces other than religion and religiousness are also important in their impact on childbearing. A multivariate analysis demonstrates that relatively ``traditional'' socioeconomic covariates (age, marital status, residence, education, and income) do not substantially change the positive association of religiousness and fertility. Finally, if Europeans were as religious as Americans one might theoretically expect a small fertility increase for Europe as a whole, but considerably more for Western Europe.},

Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

A common use of ontologies in Semantic Web is to enrich the current Web resources with some well-defined meaning to enhance the search capabilities of existing web searching systems. This paper reports on how ontologies developed in the EU Semantic Web project SPIRIT are used to support retrieval of documents that are considered to be spatially relevant to users' queries. The query expansion techniques presented in this paper are based on both a domain and a geographical ontology. The proposed techniques are distinguished from conventional ones in that a query is expanded by derivation of its geographical query footprint. The techniques are specially designed to resolve a query (such as castles near Edinburgh) that involves spatial terms (e.g. Edinburgh) and fuzzy spatial relationships (e.g. near) that qualify the spatial terms. Various factors are taken into account to support intelligent expansion of a spatial query, including, spatial terms as encoded in the geographical ontology, non-spatial terms as encoded in the domain ontology, as well as the semantics of the spatial relationships and their context of use. Some experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques using sample realistic ontologies.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the administrative units (AUs) of Switzerland has accelerated dramatically in the last 20 years. Between 1990 and 2010, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) recorded a loss of 427 municipalities, a substantial decrease compared with the decline of 75 municipalities in the 30 years before. This trend implicates an elevated rate of spatial change and makes it difficult for the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) to correctly assign biotope objects to a municipality. Such an accurate reference is necessary because the cantons often entrust the municipalities with the responsibility to protect the biotopes within their boundaries. Hence, the location of a biotope has legal and financial consequences that may change as a result of boundary changes. Despite the relevance of spatial change, there is still a lack of an information system that supports queries on spatial change of municipalities. This stems from the fact that the thematic and the geometric data originate from different sources and do not match. Moreover, AUs can become unrecognizable over time because neither the Historicized Municipality Register (HMR+) nor the geometric datasets give AUs an identity.},

The typical spatial perspective is based on geometric reference systems that include coordinates, distances, topology, and directions; while the alternative platial perspective is usually characterized by place names and descriptions as well as semantic relationships between places. In past decades, spacebased geographic information systems have made significant progress in terms of theories, models, functionalities, and applications. In contrast, place-based GIS are not yet well developed, although there is an increasing interest in platial and especially relational approaches.

However, it is difficult to quantify the correct mix or the spatial relations among different POI types indicative of specific urban functions. In this research, we develop a statistical framework to help discover semantically meaningful topics and functional regions based on the co-occurrence patterns of POI types. The framework applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique and incorporates user check-in activities on location-based social networks. Using a large corpus of about 100,000 Foursquare venues and user check-in behavior in the 10 most populated urban areas of the US, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by identifying distinctive types of latent topics and, further, by extracting urban functional regions using K-means clustering and Delaunay triangulation spatial constraints clustering. We show that a region can support multiple functions but with different probabilities, while the same type of functional region can span multiple geographically non-adjacent locations. Since each region can be modeled as a vector consisting of multinomial topic distributions, similar regions with regard to their thematic topic signatures can be identified. Compared with remote sensing images which mainly uncover the physical landscape of urban environments, our popularity-based POI topic modeling approach can be seen as a complementary social sensing view on urban space based on human activities.},

The boundary between these cognitive regions was found to have variable width, and region membership peaked not at the most northern or southern cells but at substantially less extreme latitudes. The authors thus concluded that region membership is about attitude, not just latitude. In the present work, we reproduce this study by approaching it from a computationalfourth-paradigmperspective, i.e., by the synthesis of high volumes of heterogeneous data from various sources. We compare the regions which we identify to those from the human-participants study of 2014, identifying differences and commonalities. Our results show a significant positive correlation to those in the original study. Beyond the extracted regions themselves, we compare and contrast the empirical and analytical approaches of these two methods, one a conventional human-participants study and the other an application of increasingly popular data-synthesis-driven research methods in GIScience.},

In the age of Big Data, it is possible to construct gazetteers in a data-driven approach by mining rich volunteered geographic information (VGI) from the Web. In this research, we build a scalable distributed platform and a highperformance geoprocessing workflow based on the Hadoop ecosystem to harvest crowd-sourced gazetteer entries. Using experiments based on geotagged datasets in Flickr, we find that the MapReduce-based workflow running on the spatially enabled Hadoop cluster can reduce the processing time compared with traditional desktop-based operations by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate how to use such a novel spatial-computing infrastructure to facilitate gazetteer research. In addition, we introduce a provenance-based trust model for quality assurance. This work offers new insights on enriching future gazetteers with the use of Hadoop clusters, and makes contributions in connecting GIS to the cloud computing environment for the next frontier of Big Geo-Data analytics.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an exploratory quantitative analysis of gendered contributions to the online mapping project OpenStreetMap (OSM), in which previous research has identified a strong male participation bias. On these grounds, theories of representation in volunteered geographic information (VGI) have argued that this kind of crowdsourced data fails to embody the geospatial interests of the wider community. The observed effects of the bias however, remain conspicuously absent from discourses of VGI and gender, which proceed with little sense of impact. This study addresses this void by analysing OSM contributions by gender and thus identifies differences in men's and women's mapping practices. An online survey uniquely captured the OSM IDs as well as the declared gender of 293 OSM users. Statistics relating to users' editing and tagging behaviours openly accessible via the `how did you contribute to OSM' wiki page were subsequently analysed. The results reveal that volumes of overall activity as well editing and tagging actions in OSM remain significantly dominated by men. They also indicate subtle but impactful differences in men's and women's preferences for modifying and creating data, as well as the tagging categories to which they contribute. Discourses of gender and ICT, gender relations in online VGI environments and competing motivational factors are implicated in these observations. As well as updating estimates of the gender participation bias in OSM, this paper aims to inform and stimulate subsequent discourses of gender and representation towards a new rationale for widening participation in VGI.},

Location mentions are particularly important in disaster messages as they can show emergency responders where problems have occurred. This article explores the sorts of locations that occur in disaster-related social messages, how well off-theshelf software identifies those locations, and what is needed to improve automated location identification, called geo-parsing. To do this, we have sampled Twitter messages from the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand. We annotated locations in messages manually to make a gold standard by which to measure locations identified by a Named Entity Recognition software. The Stanford NER software found some locations that were proper nouns, but did not identify locations that were not capitalized, local streets and buildings, or nonstandard place abbreviations and mis-spellings that are plentiful in microtext. We review how these problems might be solved in software research, and model a readable crisis map that shows crisis location clusters via enlarged place labels.},

  abstract = {Abstract The location of the author of a social media message is not invariably the same as the location that the author writes about in the message. In applications that mine these messages for information such as tracking news, political events or responding to disasters, it is the geographic content of the message rather than the location of the author that is important. To this end, we present a method to geo-parse the short, informal messages known as microtext. Our preliminary investigation has shown that many microtext messages contain place references that are abbreviated, misspelled, or highly localized. These references are missed by standard geo-parsers. Our geo-parser is built to find such references. It uses Natural Language Processing methods to identify references to streets and addresses, buildings and urban spaces, and toponyms, and place acronyms and abbreviations. It combines heuristics, open-source Named Entity Recognition software, and machine learning techniques. Our primary data consisted of Twitter messages sent immediately following the February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. The algorithm identified location in the data sample, Twitter messages, giving an F statistic of 0.85 for streets, 0.86 for buildings, 0.96 for toponyms, and 0.88 for place abbreviations, with a combined average F of 0.90 for identifying places. The same data run through a geo-parsing standard, Yahoo! Placemaker, yielded an F statistic of zero for streets and buildings (because Placemaker is designed to find neither streets nor buildings), and an F of 0.67 for toponyms.},

However, to provide help, authorities need to identify informative posts on the network from the vast amount of non-informative ones to better know what is actually happening. Traditional methods for identifying informative posts put emphasis on the presence or absence of certain words which has limitations for classifying these posts. In contrast, in this paper, we propose to consider the (overall) distribution of words in the post. To do this, based on the distributional hypothesis in linguistics, we assume that each tweet is a distribution from which we have drawn a sample of words. Building on recent developments in learning methods, namely learning on distributions, we propose an approach which identifies informative tweets by using distributional assumption. Extensive experiments have been performed on Twitter data from more than 20 crisis incidents of nearly all types of incidents. These experiments show the superiority of the proposed approach in a number of real crisis incidents. This implies that better modelling of the content of a tweet based on recent advances in estimating distributions and using domain-specific knowledge for various types of crisis incidents such as floods or earthquakes, may help to achieve higher accuracy in the task.},

We explore the quality of information that can be derived either directly or indirectly from microblog entries regarding locations of ongoing events. Contrary to prior work that used Twitter to map regions of largefootprint events, or derived coarse-grained location information, in this paper, we are interested in point-events, such as building fires or car accidents, and aim to pin-point them down to a street address. An algorithm is presented that identifies distinct event signatures in the blogosphere, clusters microblogs based on events they describe, and analyzes the resulting clusters for fine-grained location indicators. An exact event location is then derived by fusing these indicators. To evaluate the quality of derived location information, we use road-traffic-related Twitter feeds from 3 major cities in California and compare automatic event localization within our service to manually obtained ground truth data. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically determined locations and ground-truth.},

Inter-city interaction facilitated by HSR tends to play a more prominent role in promoting urban and regional economic integration and development. Quantifying the impact of HSR's interaction on cities and people is therefore crucial for long-term urban and regional development planning and policy making. We develop an evaluation framework using toponym information from social media as a proxy to estimate the dynamics of such impact. This paper adopts two types of spatial information: toponyms from social media posts, and the geographical location information embedded in social media posts. The framework highlights the asymmetric nature of social interaction among cities, and proposes a series of metrics to quantify such impact from multiple perspectives {\textendash} including interaction strength, spatial decay, and channel effect. The results show that HSRs not only greatly expand the uneven distribution of inter-city connections, but also significantly reshape the interactions that occur along HSR routes through the channel effect.},

Sites such as Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork of geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop interesting applications using their own data. I review this phenomenon, and examine associated issues: what drives people to do this, how accurate are the results, will they threaten individual privacy, and how can they augment more conventional sources? I compare this new phenomenon to more traditional citizen science and the role of the amateur in geographic observation.},

Toponyms, places names referenced in messages, provide another source of geographic information, however, the availability and granularity of toponyms in crisis social media remain poorly understood. This study examines toponym usage and granularity across six categories of crisis-related information posted on Twitter during a severe storm. Findings show users often include geographic information in messages describing local and remote storm events but do so rarely when discussing other topics, more often use toponyms than geotags when describing local events, and tend to include fine-grained toponyms in reports of infrastructure damage and service disruption and course-grained toponyms in other kinds of storm-related messages. These findings present requirements for hyperlocal geoparsing techniques and suggest that social media monitoring presents more immediate affordances for course-grained damage assessment than fine-grained situational awareness during a crisis.},

The connections afforded to all of those people, in theory, allow for an unprecedented amount of communication and public participation. The goal of this article is to examine how those potentials match up to actual patterns of participation. By focusing on Wikipedia, the world's largest and most used repository of user-generated content, we are able to gain important insights into the geographies of voice and participation. This article shows that the relative democratization of the Internet has not brought about a concurrent democratization of voice and participation. Despite the fact that it is widely used around the world, Wikipedia is characterized by highly uneven geographies of participation. The goal of highlighting these inequalities is not to suggest that they are insurmountable. Our regression analysis shows that the availability of broadband is a clear factor in the propensity of people to participate on Wikipedia. The relationship is not a linear one, though. As a country approaches levels of connectivity above about 450,000 broadband Internet connections, the ability of broadband access to positively affect participation keeps increasing. Complicating this issue is the fact that participation from the world's economic peripheries tends to focus on editing about the world's cores rather than their own local regions. These results ultimately point to an informational magnetism that is cast by the world's economic cores, virtuous and vicious cycles that make it difficult to reconfigure networks and hierarchies of knowledge production.},

  abstract = {Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places. These geographies of information about places matter because they shape how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world. Places invisible or discounted in representations are invisible in practice to many people. In other words, geographic augmentations are much more than just representations of places: they are part of the place itself; they shape it rather than simply reflect it. This fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are immutable means that annotations of place emerge as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations. This paper therefore explores how information geographies have their own geographic distributions: geographies of access, of participation, and of representation. The paper offers a deliberately broad survey of a range of key platforms that mediate, host, and deliver different types of geographic information. It does so using a combination of existing statistics and bespoke data not previously mapped or analysed. Through this effort, the paper demonstrates that in addition to the geographies of uneven access to contemporary modes of communication, uneven geographies of participation and representation are also evident and in some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated. In other words, the paper comprehensively shows one important facet of contemporary information geographies: that geographic information itself is characterised by a host of uneven geographies. The paper concludes that there are few signs that global informational peripheries are achieving comparable levels of participation or representation with traditional information cores, despite the hopes that the fast-paced spread of the internet to three billion people might change this pattern.},

  abstract = {This paper examines dependence on the car in rural Scotland, assesses the impact of the fuel duty escalator on rural communities and discusses the role of the new Scottish Executive in shaping future rural transport policy. Questionnaires, interviews and travel diaries were used in "ve areas and revealed that households in rural Scotland enjoy high levels of car ownership, and that the car is used for over three-quarters of all journeys. Isolation and income levels are the most signi"cant predictors of car use. Those living in \&removed' areas * i.e. locations distant from main roads and/or bus routes * are more likely to own vehicles and make a higher proportion of their journeys by car. A\%uent households enjoy higher levels of car ownership, and make more journeys over greater distances by this mode than those on low-incomes. Less a\%uent households are also more likely to have disposed of a vehicle without replacing it, suggesting a more \#uctuating dependence on the car. Although those living in rural Scotland appear to count on the car, a distinction is made between those who have no alternative (structurally dependent) and those who have alternatives but rely on their vehicles. It is di\$cult to predict the exact impact of the fuel duty escalator, but it is argued that the majority of households will cope with increases in the cost of motoring, while a signi"cant minority of low income households in isolated areas will struggle to absorb the extra cost. The study highlights the need for the Scottish legislature to secure additional funding in order to sustain rural communities in the face of the rising fuel costs and suggests that an appropriate policy response might be to support isolated shops and services, i.e. subsidising alternatives to the journey as well as alternatives to the car. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our study seeks to assess the relationship between these attributes in residents of the city of Liverpool. Method: Evidence is drawn from a sample survey of 407 adults living in 21 tower blocks. A number of social and psychosocial attributes linked with feelings of safety are compared with self-reported health status using logistic and multiple regression techniques. Possible reciprocal relationships were investigated using two-stage least squares. Results: Fear of crime in this sample is generally much lower in the home than in Britain as a whole and much higher out on the neighbouring streets at night, but there are sub-group variations. We find significant associations between fear of crime and health status. Feelings of safety when out alone after dark is the most consistent predictor of health status. Those feeling safe score significantly higher on all five dimensions of the SF-36 measure which cover mental and social well-being. Mental health is the strongest correlate and is probably a consequence rather than cause of feelings of safety. Conclusion: The evidence suggests elderly residents believe tower blocks provide safe accommodation. However, feelings of safety in these `fortresses' do not generally extend to walking in neighbouring streets. Fear of crime erodes quality of life and is associated with poorer health.},

The methodology used includes a combination of mental maps and interviews for examining perceptions of territorial boundaries, with tracking technology (GPS) and activity diaries to track the actual use of space. This methodology was implemented in a pilot study with a sample of 18 women living in Jerusalem, including secular Jews, ultra-orthodox Jews, and Palestinian Muslims. The study found a very strong relationship between perceived personal territory and actual spatial activity. However, while the secular Jewish women appeared to be completely segregated within their territory, the ultra-orthodox Jewish women and the Palestinian Muslim women were both very active within the secular Jewish territory, but avoided each other's territories. The analysis of mental maps and actual spatial patterns of residential daily activities challenges prevailing notions about the spatial structure of Jerusalem and the internal power relations between the populations that inhabit it. More generally, it provides a new methodological approach for investigating segregation in cities.},

Conventionally, researchers capture relative national identity through the Linz-Moreno question, but previous research demonstrates the limitations of this measure. Many researchers now use Relative Territorial Identity (RTI) as an alternative. However, the potential limitations of this approach are yet to be explored. I provide that examination here. After reiterating the limits of the Linz-Moreno question, I use data for England, Scotland, and Wales to highlight that RTI has similar issues to the Linz-Moreno (linearity, intensity, dual identity). Following this, I use data from Flanders and Wallonia to demonstrate the limits of conflating attachment and identity when using RTI, as respondents treat the concepts differently. Overall, these results highlight the limits of existing measures of relative identity, which have important implications for how researchers examine substate territories.},

The ability to geo-locate events in textual reports represents a valuable source of information in many real-world applications such as emergency responses, real-time social media geographical event analysis, understanding location instructions in auto-response systems and more. However, geoparsing is still widely regarded as a challenge because of domain language diversity, place name ambiguity, metonymic language and limited leveraging of context as we show in our analysis. Results to date, whilst promising, are on laboratory data and unlike in wider NLP are often not cross-compared. In this study, we evaluate and analyse the performance of a number of leading geoparsers on a number of corpora and highlight the challenges in detail. We also publish an automatically geotagged Wikipedia corpus to alleviate the dearth of (open source) corpora in this domain.},

  abstract = {The purpose of text geolocation is to associate geographic information contained in a document with a set (or sets) of coordinates, either implicitly by using linguistic features and/or explicitly by using geographic metadata combined with heuristics. We introduce a geocoder (location mention disambiguator) that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on three diverse datasets by exploiting the implicit lexical clues. Moreover, we propose a new method for systematic encoding of geographic metadata to generate two distinct views of the same text. To that end, we introduce the Map Vector (MapVec), a sparse representation obtained by plotting prior geographic probabilities, derived from population figures, on a World Map. We then integrate the implicit (language) and explicit (map) features to significantly improve a range of metrics. We also introduce an open-source dataset for geoparsing of news events covering global disease outbreaks and epidemics to help future evaluation in geoparsing.},

  abstract = {Milan Gritta The Natural Language Processing task we focus on in this thesis is Geoparsing. Geoparsing is the process of extraction and grounding of toponyms (place names). Consider this sentence: "The victims of the Spanish earthquake off the coast of Malaga were of American and Mexican o rigin." Four toponyms will be extracted (called Geotagging) and grounded to their geographic coordinates (called Toponym Resolution). However, our research goes further than any previous work by showing how to distinguish the literal place(s) of the event (Spain, Malaga) from other linguistic types/uses such as nationalities (Mexican, American), improving downstream task accuracy. We consolidate and extend the Standard Evaluation Framework, discuss key research problems, then present concrete solutions in order to advance each stage of geoparsing. For geotagging, as well as training a SOTA neural Location-NER tagger, we simplify Metonymy Resolution with a novel minimalist feature extraction combined with an LSTM-based classifier, matching SOTA results. For toponym resolution, we deploy the latest deep learning methods to achieve SOTA performance by augmenting neural models with hitherto unused geographic features called Map Vectors. With each research project, we provide high quality datasets and system prototypes, further building resources in this field. We then show how these geoparsing advances coupled with our proposed Intra-Document Analysis can be used to associate news articles with locations in order to monitor the spread of public health threats. To this end, we evaluate our research contributions with production data from a real-time downstream application to improve geolocation of news events for disease monitoring. The data was made available to us by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which operates one such system called MediSys that processes incoming news articles in order to monitor threats to public health and make these available to a variety of governmental, business and non-profit organisations. We also discuss steps towards an end-to-end, automated news monitoring system and make actionable recommendations for future work. In summary, the thesis aims are twofold: (1) Generate original geoparsing research aimed at advancing each stage of the pipeline by addressing pertinent challenges with concrete solutions and actionable proposals. (2) Demonstrate how this research can be applied to news event monitoring to increase the efficacy of existing biosurveillance systems, e.g. European Commission's MediSys.},

  abstract = {Empirical methods in geoparsing have thus far lacked a standard evaluation framework describing the task, metrics and data used to compare state-of-theart systems. Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even unrepresentative of real world usage by the lack of distinction between the different types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation of metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript introduces a new framework in three parts. (Part 1) Task Definition: clarified via corpus linguistic analysis proposing a fine-grained Pragmatic Taxonomy of Toponyms. (Part 2) Metrics: discussed and reviewed for a rigorous evaluation including recommendations for NER/Geoparsing practitioners. (Part 3) Evaluation data: shared via a new dataset called GeoWebNews to provide test/train examples and enable immediate use of our contributions. In addition to fine-grained Geotagging and Toponym Resolution (Geocoding), this dataset is also suitable for prototyping and evaluating machine learning NLP models.},

More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of Web 2.0 mapping applications, the most striking example of a geographical application is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed `Volunteered Geographical Information' (VGI) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80\% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29\% of the area of England, of which approximately 24\% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings to the study of VGI as well as suggesting future research directions.},

The paper sets out the links between these changes in the London context.

Predominately, social media geolocation models are based on full text data, including common words with no geospatial dimension (e.g. today) and noisy strings (tmrw), potentially hampering prediction and leading to slower/more memory-intensive models. In this paper, we focus on finding location indicative words (LIWs) via feature selection, and establishing whether the reduced feature set boosts geolocation accuracy. Our results show that an information gain ratiobased approach surpasses other methods at LIW selection, outperforming state-of-the-art geolocation prediction methods by 10.6\% in accuracy and reducing the mean and median of prediction error distance by 45km and 209km, respectively, on a public dataset. We further formulate notions of prediction confidence, and demonstrate that performance is even higher in cases where our model is more confident, striking a trade-off between accuracy and coverage. Finally, the identified LIWs reveal regional language differences, which could be potentially useful for lexicographers.},

However, these references are often buried in informal, ungrammatical, and multilingual data, and are therefore non-trivial to identify and exploit. We present an integrated geolocation prediction framework and investigate what factors impact on prediction accuracy. First, we evaluate a range of feature selection methods to obtain ``location indicative words''. We then evaluate the impact of nongeotagged tweets, language, and user-declared metadata on geolocation prediction. In addition, we evaluate the impact of temporal variance on model generalisation, and discuss how users differ in terms of their geolocatability.},

Firstly, Lidar point clouds are projected into the monocular images by cross calibration to get the sparse height images, and then we get high-resolution height images via a joint bilateral filter. Then, for all the training image pixels which have corresponding Lidar points, we extract their features from color image and Lidar point clouds, respectively, and use these features together with the location features to train an Adaboost classifier. After that, all the testing pixels are classified into road or non-road under a conditional random field framework. In this conditional random field framework, we use the scores computed from the Adaboost classifier as the unary potential and take the height value of each pixel and its color information into consideration together for the pairwise potential. Finally, experimental tests have been carried out on the KITTI Road data set, and the results show that our method performs well on this data set.},

  abstract = {Many domain-specific websites host a profile page for each entity (e.g., locations on Foursquare, movies on IMDb, and products on Amazon) for users to post comments on. When commenting on an entity, users often mention other entities for reference or comparison. Compared with web pages and tweets, the problem of disambiguating the mentioned entities in user comments has not received much attention. This paper investigates linking fine-grained locations in Foursquare comments. We demonstrate that the focal location, i.e., the location that a comment is posted on, provides rich contexts for the linking task. To exploit such information, we represent the Foursquare data in a graph, which includes locations, comments, and their relations. A probabilistic model named FocalLink is proposed to estimate the probability that a user mentions a location when commenting on a focal location, by following different kinds of relations. Experimental results show that FocalLink is consistently superior under different collective linking settings.},

The collective information generated from these online platforms is overwhelming, in terms of both the amount of content produced every moment and the diversity of topics discussed. The real-time nature of the information produced by users has prompted researchers to analyse this content, in order to gain timely insight into the current state of affairs. Specifically, the microblogging service Twitter has been a recent focus of researchers to gather information on events occurring in real time. This article presents a survey of a wide variety of event detection methods applied to streaming Twitter data, classifying them according to shared common traits, and then discusses different aspects of the subtasks and challenges involved in event detection. We believe this survey will act as a guide and starting point for aspiring researchers to gain a structured view on state-of-the-art real-time event detection and spur further research in this direction.},

Road marking is a signalization present on road surfaces and commonly used to inform the correct lane cars must keep. Cameras have been widely used for road marking detection, however they are sensible to environment illumination. Some LIDAR sensors return infrared reflective intensity information which is insensible to illumination condition. Existing road marking detectors that analyzes reflective intensity data focus only on lane markings and ignores other types of signalization. We propose a road marking detector based on Otsu thresholding method that make possible segment LIDAR point clouds into asphalt and road marking. The results show the possibility of detecting any road marking (crosswalks, continuous lines, dashed lines). The road marking detector has also been integrated with Monte Carlo localization method so that its performance could be validated. According to the results, adding road markings onto curb maps lead to a lateral localization error of 0.3119 m.},

However, as additional applications gain importance, such as advanced driver information and warning systems, more detailed and accurate information on the true road geometry has to be incorporated into those databases. Properties like height, longitudinal and transversal slope, curvature, and width which are currently not present, have to be acquired and integrated. This article shows how existing databases either from public authorities or from private map providers can be used in combination with aerial laser scan data to derive such properties. Apart from a general discussion of the problem and our approach, first results are presented and discussed.},

In this paper, agent-based simulation is used to determine the allocation of resources for a two-site incident which minimizes the latest hospital arrival times for critically injured casualties. Further, how the optimal resource allocation depends on the distribution of casualties across the two sites is investigated. Such application supports the use of agentbased simulation as a tool to aid emergency response.},

The deprivation measure most closely related to poor health in the least accessible rural wards was male unemployment, but use of this measure did not remove the urban{$\pm$}rural gradient of association strength. Neither did replacing wards by smaller enumeration districts as the units of analysis. The differences between urban and rural correlations were removed by restricting the comparison to wards with the same unemployment range and combining pairs of rural wards with similar deprivation values. Apparent differences between rural and urban associations are therefore not due to the choice of deprivation indices or census areas but are artifacts of the greater internal variability, smaller average deprivation range and smaller population size of rural small areas. Deprived people with poor health in rural areas are hidden by favourable averages of health and deprivation measures and do not bene{\textregistered}t from resource allocations based on area values. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Utilizing a geostatistics-based approach, we demonstrate that, on a per capita basis, these important VGI datasets have more users, more information, and higher quality information within metropolitan areas than outside of them. VGI is a subset of user-generated content (UGC) and we discuss how our results suggest that urban biases might exist in non-geographically referenced UGC as well. Finally, because Foursquare is exclusively made up of VGI, we argue that Foursquare (and possibly other location-based social networks) has fundamentally failed to appeal to rural populations.},

However, both discourses have one thing in common: they neglect the territorial and thus physical dimension of global flows. Hence, in this article I take the perspective of material flows to reconnect the discourses on cities and chains. I aim to clarify the role of urban places and their ability to attract, manage and redirect flows in such networks. I do so by re-examining classical concepts of spatial interaction and reorganization in human geography, with particular reference to centrality and intermediacy. The case of seaports and port cities is further explored to demonstrate the concrete conflicts and opportunities that arise with chain developments and insertion. To determine the relative position of places with regard to global chains and flows, Sheppard's concept of `positionality' is discussed.},

The main aim of this paper is to review the use of GIS-based measures in exploring the relationship between geographic access, utilisation, quality and health outcomes. The varieties of approaches taken by researchers concerned with teasing out the relative importance of geographical factors that may influence access are examined. To date, in the absence of detailed data on health utilisation patterns, much of this research has focused on developing measures of potential accessibility. This paper then critically evaluates the situation with regard to the use of such measures in a broad range of accessibility studies. In particular, there has been less research to date that examines the relationship between such measures and health outcomes. In the final sections of the paper, I draw on the review to outline areas where a broader research agenda is needed, particularly in relation to more recent innovations in health care delivery.},

  abstract = {Debate about rural policy is often based on persistent presumptions about conditions in `rural England', generally associated with economic decline, low incomes, and a lack of services. Such generalisations are rarely justified for rural areas as a whole and we term them as `stylised fallacies'. The impression of their relevance is perpetuated by the selective comparison of statistics for `urban' and `rural' areas. The paper reviews the evidence on a number of such fallacies: the economic impact of agriculture, depopulation, low incomes, rural labour markets, house prices and service provision. In each case, the position is far more complex than is commonly recognised in policy debate. The rural character of an area does not in itself offer a rationale for policy intervention. Rather, discussion could be supported through the characterisation of different types of local area. This might be approached either through statistical analysis or through qualitative analysis of emerging social and economic patterns of differentiation. In practice, each approach needs to be supported through the other.},

Exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution remains a difficult challenge because of substantial small-scale spatial variation. Current approaches for assessing intra-urban air pollution contrasts include the use of exposure indicator variables, interpolation methods, dispersion models and land-use regression (LUR) models. LUR models have been increasingly used in the past few years. This paper provides a critical review of the different components of LUR models.},

Here, we explore such language by harvesting georeferenced and tagged metadata associated with 8 million Flickr images and thus consider how large numbers of people name city core areas. The nature of errors and imprecision in tagging and georeferencing are quantified, and automatically generated precision measures appear to mirror errors in the positioning of images. Users seek to ascribe appropriate semantics to images, though bulk-uploading and bulk-tagging may introduce bias. Between 0.5-2\% of tags associated with georeferenced images analyzed describe city core areas generically, while 70\% of all georeferenced images analyzed include specific place name tags, with place names at the granularity of city names being by far the most common. Using Flickr metadata, it is possible not only to describe the use of the term Downtown across the USA, but also to explore the borders of city center neighborhoods at the level of individual cities, whilst accounting for bias by the use of tag profiles.},

  abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

  year = {2004},
  pages = {5},
  abstract = {Automated and reliable 3D city model acquisition is an increasing demand. Automatic road extraction from dense urban areas is a challenging issue due to the high complex image scene. From imagery, the obstacles of the extraction stem mainly from the difficulty of finding clues of the roads and complexity of the contextual environments. One of the promising methods to deal with this is to use data sources from multi-sensors, by which the multiple clues and constraints can be obtained so that the uncertainty can be minimized significantly. This paper focuses on the integrated processing of high resolution imagery and LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data for automatic extraction of grid structured urban road network. Under the guidance of an explicit model of the urban roads in a grid structure, the method firstly detects the primitives or clues of the roads and the contextual targets (i.e., parking lots, grasslands) both from the color image and lidar data by segmentation and image analysis. Evidences of road existing are contained in the primitives. The candidate road stripes are detected by an iterative Hough transform algorithm. This is followed by an procedure of evidence finding and validation by taking advantage of high resolution imagery and direct height information of the scene derived from lidar data. Finally the road network is formed by topology analysis. In this paper, the strategy and corresponding algorithms are described. The test data set is color ortho-imagery with 0.5 m resolution and lidar data of Toronto downtown area. The experimental results in the typical dense urban scene indicate it is able to extract the roads much more reliable and accurate by the integrated processing than by using imagery or lidar separately. It saliently exhibits advantages of the integrated processing of the multiple data sources for the road extraction from the complicated scenes.},

  abstract = {News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness between cities; yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can `read' a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the top 100 US cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualizations of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.},

This kind of data is referred to as geotext data. The availability of large amounts of geo-text data brings both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, it is challenging to automatically process this kind of data due to the unstructured texts and the complex spatial footprints of some places. On the other hand, geo-text data offers unique research opportunities through the rich information contained in texts and the special links between texts and geography. As a result, geo-text data facilitates various studies especially those in data-driven geospatial semantics. This paper discusses geo-text data and related concepts. With a focus on data-driven research, this paper systematically reviews a large number of studies that have discovered multiple types of knowledge from geo-text data. Based on the literature review, a generalized workflow is extracted and key challenges for future work are discussed.},

While not always recorded, local place names play important roles in many applications, from supporting public participation in urban planning to locating victims in disaster response. In this paper, we propose a computational framework for harvesting local place names from geotagged housing advertisements. We make use of those advertisements posted on local-oriented websites, such as Craigslist, where local place names are often mentioned. The proposed framework consists of two stages: natural language processing (NLP) and geospatial clustering. The NLP stage examines the textual content of housing advertisements and extracts place name candidates. The geospatial stage focuses on the coordinates associated with the extracted place name candidates and performs multiscale geospatial clustering to filter out the non-place names. We evaluate our framework by comparing its performance with those of six baselines. We also compare our result with four existing gazetteers to demonstrate the not-yet-recorded local place names discovered by our framework.},

Attempts have been made to identify urban functional regions using high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and extensive geodata. However, the research scale and throughput have also been limited by the accessibility of HSR remote sensing data. Recently, big geo-data are becoming increasingly popular for urban studies since research is still accessible and objective with regard to the use of these data. This study aims to build a novel framework to provide an alternative solution for sensing urban spatial structure and discovering urban functional regions based on emerging geo-data {\textendash} points of interest (POIs) data and an embedding learning method in the natural language processing (NLP) field. We started by constructing the intraurban functional corpus using a centercontext pairs-based approach. A word embeddings representation model for training that corpus was used to extract multiprototype vectors in the second step, and the last step aggregated the functional parcels based on an introduced spatial clustering method, hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). The clustering results suggested that our proposed framework used in this study is capable of discovering the utilization of urban space with a reasonable level of accuracy. The limitation and potential improvement of the proposed framework are also discussed.},

The core of the approach is to learn the intrinsic characteristics of multi-word place names with deep learn\- ing from gazetteers. Specifically, GazPNE consists of a rule-based system to select n-grams from the microblogs that potentially contain place names, and a C-LSTM model that decides if the selected n-gram is a place name or not. The C-LSTM is trained on 388.1 million examples containing 6.8 million positive examples with US and Indian place names extracted from OpenStreetMap and 381.3 million negative examples synthesized by rules. We evaluate GazPNE against the SoTA on a manually annotated 4,500 tweet dataset which contains 9,026 place names from three foods: 2016 in Louisiana (US), 2016 in Houston (US), and 2015 in Chennai (India).

Geo-tagged Twitter data offers an unprecedented database with rich linguistic representation of fine spatiotemporal resolution and continuity. From the one-year Twitter corpus, we extract lexical characteristics for twitter users by summarizing the frequencies of a set of lexical alternations that each user has used. We spatially aggregate and smooth each lexical characteristic to derive county-based linguistic variables, from which orthogonal dimensions are extracted using the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally a regionalization method is used to discover hierarchical dialect regions with using the PCA components. The regionalization results reveal interesting linguistic regional variations in the U.S. The discovered regions not only confirm past research findings in the literature but also provide new insights and a more detailed understanding of very recent linguistic patterns in the U.S.},

  abstract = {The road map is a fundamental part of a spatial data infrastructure (SDI), and is widely applied in navigation, smart transportation, and mobile location services. Recently, with the ubiquity of positioning devices, crowdsourced trajectories have become a significant data resource for road map construction and updating. However, existing trajectory-\- based methods mainly place emphasis on extracting road geometry features and may ignore continuous updating of road semantic information. Hence, we propose a divide-\- and-\-conquer method to construct a spatial-\-semantic road map by incorporating multiple data sources (e.g., crowdsourced trajectories and geo-\-tagged data). The proposed method divides road map construction into two sub-\-tasks, road structure reconstruction and road attributes inference. The road structure reconstruction process starts to partition raw trajectory data into different cliques of roadways and road intersections, and then extracts various targeted road structures by analyzing the turning modes in different trajectory cliques. The road attributes inference process aims to infer three pieces of crucial semantic information about road speeds, turning rules, and road names from crowdsourced trajectories and geo-\-tagged data. The case studies in Wuhan were examined to illustrate that the proposed method can construct a routable road map with enhanced geometric structures and rich semantic information, providing a beneficial data solution for car navigation and SDI update.},

  abstract = {Social media and other online communication tools are a subject of great interest in mass emergency response. Members of the public are turning to these solutions to seek and offer emergency information. Emergency responders are working to determine what social media policies should be in terms of their ``public information'' functions. We report on the online communications from all the coastal fire and police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane Sandy's US landfall. Across four types of online communication media, we collected data from 840 fire and police departments. Findings indicate that few departments used these online channels in their Sandy response efforts, and that communications differed between fire and police departments and across media type. However, among the highly engaged departments, there is evidence that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes appropriate public communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore, we propose that flexibility is important in considering future emergency online communication policy. We conclude with design recommendations for making online communication media more ``listenable'' for both emergency managers and members of the public.},

  abstract = {LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) is a powerful remote sensing technology for the acquisition of terrain surface. The LIDAR system not only generates the 3D points cloud with irregular spacing, but also detects the laser impulse reflection data. The algorithms used for the LIDAR data are mostly used to deal with the 3D points cloud, produce the digital terrain model (DTM) and detect the objects, such as buildings. Usually, these objects must be classified as part of the extraction. In order to classify, other information besides the height information of points cloud is required, such as laser intensity information. However, few classification algorithms using intensity data have been deeply investigated. The laser intensity is different from material to material. The intensity of reflection on the same material is similar, while pulsed on different material is differ. Based on this theory, this paper provides a classification algorithm of airborne laser scanning altimetry data combined with the intensity of laser in detail.},

One specific case of this problem is the task of automatically detecting roads. This task is a difficult vision problem because of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of non-road objects. Despite 30 years of work on automatic road detection, no automatic or semi-automatic road detection system is currently on the market and no published method has been shown to work reliably on large datasets of urban imagery. We propose detecting roads using a neural network with millions of trainable weights which looks at a much larger context than was used in previous attempts at learning the task. The network is trained on massive amounts of data using a consumer GPU. We demonstrate that predictive performance can be substantially improved by initializing the feature detectors using recently developed unsupervised learning methods as well as by taking advantage of the local spatial coherence of the output labels. We show that our method works reliably on two challenging urban datasets that are an order of magnitude larger than what was used to evaluate previous approaches.},

  abstract = {The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that{\textemdash}even in very highdimensional cases{\textemdash}most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {Endemic problems in EU `lagging rural regions' (LRRs) are well documented and various support mechanisms have long been in place to help overcome structural difficulties. Nevertheless, new rural development architectures are now being sought and some scholars have posited that LRRs may benefit from the `quality (re)turn' in food and a relative shift from long to short food supply chains. The ways in which this `new agriculture' relates to rural development in lagging regions sound fine in theory. However, in practice it is far from clear what will actually happen, where and how. This paper attempts to answer some of these questions and, using a Delphi technique, to forecast those factors likely to influence supply chain development and performance in two LRRs in the UK: West Wales and the Scottish{\textendash}English Borders. The findings suggest that while most experts willingly accept the socio-economic values that can be gained by localising, shortening and synergising the food chain in LRRs, there are also important barriers that question the emergence of such an agrarian based rural development dynamic. These include the small number and size of `alternative' producers in both locales, with most still locked into industrial forms of production; the restrictive influence of bureaucracy; the shortfall of key intermediaries in both regions' food chains; and the poor provision of key physical infrastructures (e.g. roads, railway and telecommunications). The Delphi method also reveals how expert opinions about rural development in LRRs are contingent and contested, with contradictions emerging within, as well as between, rounds.},

This will make it harder for a low- and moderate-income households to live near the projects, and neighborhoods are likely to become increasingly affluent. The Atlanta Beltline will ultimately connect 45 Atlanta neighborhoods via a 22-mile loop of trails, parks, and eventually a streetcar, all of which follow abandoned railroad tracks. This paper examines the effect of the Beltline on housing values within one half mile. From 2011 to 2015, depending on the segment of the Beltline, values rose between 17.9 percent and 26.6 percent more for homes within a half-mile of the Beltline than elsewhere. The implications for housing affordability and neighborhood change of projects like the Beltline, and associated policy questions, are addressed.},

But the volume and velocity of tweets posted during crises today tend to be extremely high, making it hard for disaster-affected communities and professional emergency responders to process the information in a timely manner. Furthermore, posts tend to vary highly in terms of their subjects and usefulness; from messages that are entirely off-topic or personal in nature, to messages containing critical information that augments situational awareness. Finding actionable information can accelerate disaster response and alleviate both property and human losses. In this paper, we describe automatic methods for extracting information from microblog posts. Specifically, we focus on extracting valuable ``information nuggets'', brief, self-contained information items relevant to disaster response. Our methods leverage machine learning methods for classifying posts and information extraction. Our results, validated over one large disaster-related dataset, reveal that a careful design can yield an effective system, paving the way for more sophisticated data analysis and visualization systems.},

As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings. We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.},

Processing social media information pose multiple challenges such as parsing noisy, brief and informal messages, learning information categories from the incoming stream of messages and classifying them into different classes among others.

The limited research to date has been focused on VGI data of linear features and has shown that the error in the data is heterogeneously distributed. Some have argued that data produced by numerous contributors will produce a more accurate product than an individual and some research on crowd-sourced initiatives has shown that to be true, although research on VGI is more infrequent. This paper proposes a method for quantifying the completeness and accuracy of a select subset of infrastructure-associated point datasets of volunteered geographic data within a major metropolitan area using a national geospatial dataset as the reference benchmark with two datasets from volunteers used as test datasets.

  abstract = {By utilizing cognitive mapping and leveraging georeferenced text data, this paper aims to suggest a new visualization method that combines the advantages of both conventional and state-of-the-art research techniques to depict the collective identity of place in a single image. The study addressed two research questions: (1) Can crowd-sourced text data be utilized in representing place identity? (2) Can collective place identity be expressed in the form of a cognitive map? By confirming that text data gathered from social media effectively demonstrate people's behaviors and perceptions related to places, we propose a novel method to create a visual representation of urban identity{\textendash}a ``crowd-sourced cognitive map''. In particular, to improve the conventional cognitive mapping method to depict the collective identity of a city, we draw cognitive maps of Bundang and Ilsan developed in the 1990s, as well as Songdo and Dongtan developed in the 2000s, just outside of the administrative boundaries of Seoul in Korea, through a computational method based on crowd-sourced opinions collected from social media. We open the possibility for the use of social media text data to capture the identity of cities and suggest a graphical image through which people without prior information could also easily apprehend the overall image of a city. The work in this paper is expected to provide a methodological technique for appropriate decision-making and the evaluation of urban identity to shape a more unique and imageable city.},

  abstract = {Similarity measures have a long tradition in fields such as information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. Within the last years, these measures have been extended and reused to measure semantic similarity; i.e., for comparing meanings rather than syntactic differences. Various measures for spatial applications have been developed, but a solid foundation for answering what they measure, how they are best applied in information retrieval, which role contextual information plays, and how similarity values or rankings should be interpreted is still missing. It is therefore difficult to decide which measure should be used for a particular application or to compare results from different similarity theories. Based on a review of existing similarity measures, we introduce a framework to specify the semantics of similarity. We discuss similarity-based information retrieval paradigms as well as their implementation in web-based user interfaces for geographic information retrieval to demonstrate the applicability of the framework. Finally, we formulate open challenges for similarity research.},

As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated `turns' within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphy{\"o}the organization of sociospatial relations in multiple forms{\"o}within sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the `TPSN framework' to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism.},

Meanwhile, population bias in geotagged Twitter users is widely recognized. Understanding the demographic and socioeconomic biases of Twitter users is critical for making reliable inferences on the attitudes and behaviors of the population. However, the existing global models cannot capture the regional variations of the demographic and socioeconomic biases. To bridge the gap, we modeled the relationships between different demographic/socioeconomic factors and geotagged Twitter users for the whole contiguous United States, aiming to understand how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users at county level. To effectively identify the local Twitter users for each county of the United States, we integrate three commonly used methods and develop a query approach in a high-performance computing environment. The results demonstrate that we can not only identify how the demographic and socioeconomic factors relate to the number of Twitter users, but can also measure and map how the influence of these factors vary across counties.},

In training, this paper uses the deep residual network to extract more abstract and deeper features. Then the piecewise max pooling and selective attention mechanisms are used to further improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, the experimental results show that the deeper network and the piecewise max pooling significantly improve the extraction results.},

There is a need therefore for geographical information retrieval facilities that can rank the relevance of candidate information with respect to geographical closeness as well as semantic closeness with respect to the topic of interest. Here we present an ontology of place that combines limited coordinate data with qualitative spatial relationships between places. This parsimonious model of place is intended to support information retrieval tasks that may be global in scope. The ontology has been implemented with a semantic modelling system linking non-spatial conceptual hierarchies with the place ontology. An hierarchical distance measure is combined with Euclidean distance between place centroids to create a hybrid spatial distance measure. This can be combined with thematic distance, based on classification semantics, to create an integrated semantic closeness measure that can be used for a relevance ranking of retrieved objects.},

SpanBERT consistently outperforms BERT and our better-tuned baselines, with substantial gains on span selection tasks such as question answering and coreference resolution. In particular, with the same training data and model size as BERT-large, our single model obtains 94.6\% and 88.7\% F1 on SQuAD 1.1 and 2.0, respectively.

In this paper, we present a practical real-time working prototype for road lane detection using LiDAR data, which can be further extended to automatic lane-level map generation. Conventional lane detection methods are limited to simple road conditions and are not suitable for complex urban roads with various road signs on the ground. Given a 3D point cloud scanned by a 3D LiDAR sensor, we categorized the points of the drivable region and distinguished the points of the road signs on the ground. Then, we developed an expectation-maximization method to detect parallel lines and update the 3D line parameters in real time, as the probe vehicle equipped with the LiDAR sensor moved forward. The detected and recorded line parameters were integrated to build a lane-level digital map with the help of a GPS/INS sensor. The proposed system was tested to generate accurate lane-level maps of two complex urban routes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system was fast and practical in terms of effectively detecting road lines and generating lane-level maps.},

  abstract = {In-migration is a key influence in the process of rural economic development in England, Continental Europe and the US. New arrivals are often viewed in the literature as contributors in new venture creation, as well as catalysts in enhancing ruraleurban interdependencies in the countryside. This paper sets out to explore the validity of this view in the case of East Cleveland: a rural area with a tradition of mining and industry, occupying the coastal fringe of the Tees Valley city-region. In doing so, the paper compares this locality with other parts of rural England in order to draw some wider conclusions. Particular emphasis is placed on comparisons with Cumbria, where comparable data are available. The paper argues that the impact of in-migration on the conditions of supply of entrepreneurship is cumulative rather than transformational. This means that it is particularly profound in localities with strong opportunity nexus, reinforcing favourable demand side conditions. However, the ability of in-migrant entrepreneurs to influence ruraleurban interdependencies in areas with weak opportunity nexus (such as East Cleveland) is modest. {\'O} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Toponym Resolution, the task of assigning a location mention in a document to a geographic referent (i.e., latitude/longitude), plays a pivotal role in analyzing location-aware content. However, the ambiguities of natural language and a huge number of possible interpretations for toponyms constitute insurmountable hurdles for this task. In this paper, we study the problem of toponym resolution with no additional information other than a gazetteer and no training data. We demonstrate that a dearth of large enough annotated data makes supervised methods less capable of generalizing. Our proposed method estimates the geographic scope of documents and leverages the connections between nearby place names as evidence to resolve toponyms. We explore the interactions between multiple interpretations of mentions and the relationships between different toponyms in a document to build a model that finds the most coherent resolution. Our model is evaluated on three news corpora, two from the literature and one collected and annotated by us; then, we compare our methods to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques. We also examine three commercial products including Reuters OpenCalais, Yahoo! YQL Placemaker, and Google Cloud Natural Language API. The evaluation shows that our method outperforms the unsupervised technique as well as Reuters OpenCalais and Google Cloud Natural Language API on all three corpora; also, our method shows a performance close to that of the state-of-the art supervised method and outperforms it when the test data has 40\% or more toponyms that are not seen in the training data.},

We evaluate the system on a corpus of manually geo-annotated tweets. First, we benchmark the performance of the six NERs that GeoTxt provides access to. Second, we assess GeoTxt toponym resolution accuracy incrementally, demonstrating improvements in toponym resolution achieved (or not achieved) by adding specific heuristics and disambiguation methods. Compared to using the GeoNames web service, GeoTxt's toponym resolution demonstrates a 20\% accuracy gain.

This paper reports on research into the portrayal of two social housing estates in the printed media over an extended period of time (14 years). It was found that negative and mixed coverage of the estates dominated, with the amount of positive coverage being very small. By examining the way in which dominant themes were used by newspapers in respect of each estate, questions are raised about the mode of operation of the press and the communities' collective right to challenge this. By identifying the way regeneration stories are covered and the nature of the content of positive stories, lessons are drawn for programmes of area transformation. The need for social regeneration activities is identified as an important ingredient for changing deprived-area reputations.},

Most existing gazetteers are managed strictly top-down: entries can only be added or changed by the responsible toponymic authority. The covered vocabulary is therefore often limited to an administrative view on places, using only official place names. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach for gazetteer building based on geotagged photos harvested from the web. We discuss the building blocks of a geotag and how they relate to each other to formally define the notion of a geotag. Based on this formalization, we introduce an extraction process for gazetteer entries that captures the emergent semantics of collections of geotagged photos and provides a group-cognitive perspective on named places. Using an experimental setup based on clustering and filtering algorithms, we demonstrate how to identify place names and assign adequate geographic footprints. The results for three different place names (Soho, Camino de Santiago and Kilimanjaro), representing different geographic feature types, are evaluated and compared to the results obtained from traditional gazetteers. Finally, we sketch how our approach can be combined with other (for example, linguistic) approaches and discuss how such a bottom-up gazetteer can complement existing gazetteers.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Linguistic constructs can express highly complex, relational structures of objects, spatial relations between them, and patterns of motion through spaces relative to some reference point. Learning how to map this information onto a formal representation from a text is a challenging problem. At present no well-defined framework for automatic spatial information extraction exists that can handle all of these issues. In this paper we introduce the task of spatial role labeling and propose an annotation scheme that is language-independent and facilitates the application of machine learning techniques. Our framework consists of a set of spatial roles based on the theory of holistic spatial semantics with the intent of covering all aspects of spatial concepts, including both static and dynamic spatial relations. We illustrate our annotation scheme with many examples throughout the paper, and in addition we highlight how to connect to spatial calculi such as region connection calculus and also how our approach fits into related work.},

  abstract = {Understanding spatial language is important in many applications such as geographical information systems, human computer interaction or text-to-scene conversion. Due to the challenges of designing spatial ontologies, the extraction of spatial information from natural language still has to be placed in a welldefined framework. In this work, we propose an ontology which bridges between cognitive{\textendash}linguistic spatial concepts in natural language and multiple qualitative spatial representation and reasoning models. To make a mapping between natural language and the spatial ontology, we propose a novel global machine learning framework for ontology population. In this framework we consider relational features and background knowledge which originate from both ontological relationships between the concepts and the structure of the spatial language. The advantage of the proposed global learning model is the scalability of the inference, and the flexibility for automatically describing text with arbitrary semantic labels that form a structured ontological representation of its content. The machine learning framework is evaluated with SemEval-2012 and SemEval-2013 data from the spatial role labeling task.},

Here, we report the results of initial efforts towards exploiting visual information in the form of images to help spatial language understanding. We discuss the way of designing new models in the framework of declarative learning-based programming (DeLBP). The DeLBP framework facilitates combining modalities and representing various data in a unified graph. The learning and inference models exploit the structure of the unified graph as well as the global first order domain constraints beyond the data to predict the semantics which forms a structured meaning representation of the spatial context. Continuous representations are used to relate the various elements of the graph originating from different modalities. We improved over the state-of-the-art results on SpRL.},

  abstract = {The field of clinical natural language processing has been advanced significantly since the introduction of deep learning models. The self-supervised representation learning and the transfer learning paradigm became the methods of choice in many natural language processing application, in particular in the settings with the dearth of high quality manually annotated data. Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the majority of patients' data are now being collected electronically and in particular in the form of free text. Identification of medical concepts and information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition model for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise seven categories: drug names, route, frequency, dosage, strength, form, duration. The model was first self-supervisedly pre-trained by predicting the next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients' records from MIMIC-III corpora and then fine-tuned on the named-entity recognition task. The model achieved a lenient (strict) micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 (0.893) across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1=0.762, however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a reasonable performance of F1=0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to fine-tune on the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous area-based initiatives have been implemented in deprived areas across Western-Europe with the aim to improve the socio-economic and environmental conditions in these areas. Only few of these initiatives have been scientifically evaluated for their impact on key social determinants of health, like perceived area safety. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of a Dutch area-based initiative called the District Approach on trends in perceived area safety and underlying problems in deprived target districts. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used. Repeated cross-sectional data on perceived area safety and underlying problems were obtained from the National Safety Monitor (2005{\textendash}2008) and its successor the Integrated Safety Monitor (2008{\textendash}2011). Study population consisted of 133,522 Dutch adults, including 3,595 adults from target districts. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to assess trends in self-reported general safety, physical order, social order, and non-victimization before and after the start of the District Approach mid-2008. Trends in target districts were compared with trends in various control groups. Results: Residents of target districts felt less safe, perceived less physical and social order, and were victimized more often than adults elsewhere in the Netherlands. For non-victimization, target districts showed a somewhat more positive change in trend after the start of the District Approach than the rest of the Netherlands or other deprived districts. Differences were only statistically significant in women, older adults, and lower educated adults. For general safety, physical order, and social order, there were no differences in trend change between target districts and control groups. Conclusions: Results suggest that the District Approach has been unable to improve perceptions of area safety and disorder in deprived areas, but that it did result in declining victimization rates.},

Laser scanning supplies data with a skew distribution of errors because a portion of the supplied points is not on the terrain but on the treetops. Thus, the usual interpolation and filtering has to be adapted to this new data type. We will report on the implementation of this new method. The results are in accordance with the expectations. The geomorphologic quality of the contours, computed from a terrain model derived from laser scanning, needs to be improved. Solutions are still to be found. {\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

There are also indications of such effects on first-birth rates, in the upper 20s and 30s. Whereas a high fertility among the better-educated perhaps could be explained by socioeconomic or ideational factors, it might just as well be a result of selection. When all three parity transitions are modelled jointly, with a common unobserved factor included, negative effects of educational level appear. On the whole, the effects are less clearly negative for women born in the 1950s than for those born in the 1940s or late 1930s. The cohorts from the 1950s show educational differentials in completed fertility that are quite small and to a large extent stem from a higher proportion of childlessness among the better-educated. Second-birth progression ratios are just as high for the college educated as for women with only compulsory education, and the third-birth progression ratios differ very little. This reflects weakly negative net effects of education after first birth and spill-over effects from the higher age at first birth, counterbalanced by differential selectivity of earlier parity transitions.},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, the damage caused by weather events has increased dramatically and ubiquitously. In Europe, weather catastrophes constitute a growing burden on national economies and insurance companies, not least because of the costs of precautionary measures. For a long time, the insurance sector has flagged that weather disasters are on the rise, both in terms of the number of occurrences and material damage caused. The main reasons for this are: increase in the number and area of settlements in exposed areas, the accumulation of ever more valuable and vulnerable assets in these areas, as well as the climate and environmental changes that have already taken place. This paper examines observed changes in risk of various categories of weather disasters in Europe, backed by statistical analyses of relevant, updated information originating from a valuable and quite unique source, Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE database, that is of considerable interest and value to the scientific community and beyond (e.g. in the reinsurance and insurance industries). The paper also calls for partnership in the reduction of risk of weather extremes and discusses the role of the insurance industry.},

Countries face both an increasing frequency and an increasing intensity of natural disasters resulting from climate change. During such events, citizens turn to social media platforms for disaster-related communication and information. Social media improves situational awareness, facilitates dissemination of emergency information, enables early warning systems, and helps coordinate relief efforts. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of disaster-related messages helps with the real-time monitoring and assessment of the disaster itself. We present a multiscale analysis of Twitter activity before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy. We examine the online response of 50 metropolitan areas of the United States and find a strong relationship between proximity to Sandy's path and hurricane-related social media activity. We show that real and perceived threats, together with physical disaster effects, are directly observable through the intensity and composition of Twitter's message stream. We demonstrate that per-capita Twitter activity strongly correlates with the per-capita economic damage inflicted by the hurricane. We verify our findings for a wide range of disasters and suggest that massive online social networks can be used for rapid assessment of damage caused by a large-scale disaster.},

These relationships hold after controlling for geographic distance to the hotspots as well as for the income and population densities of the regions. As the pandemic progressed in the U.S., a county's social proximity to recent COVID- 19 cases predicts future outbreaks over and above physical proximity. These results suggest data from online social networks can be useful to epidemiologists and others hoping to forecast the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19.},

In this paper, we present an algorithm which has been developed for extracting left and right road edges from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a novel combination of two modified versions of the parametric active contour or snake model. The parameters involved in the algorithm are selected empirically and are fixed for all the road sections. We have developed a novel way of initialising the snake model based on the navigation information obtained from the mobile mapping vehicle. We tested our algorithm on different types of road sections representing rural, urban and national primary road sections. The successful extraction of road edges from these multiple road section environments validates our algorithm. These findings and knowledge provide valuable insights as well as a prototype road edge extraction toolset, for both national road authorities and survey companies.},

The geographical location information of the event, as well as users, are vitally important in such scenarios. The identification of geographic location is one of the challenging tasks as the location information fields, such as user location and place name of tweets are not reliable. The extraction of location information from tweet text is difficult as it contains a lot of non-standard English, grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, non-standard abbreviations, and so on. This research aims to extract location words used in the tweet using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model. We achieved the exact matching score of 0.929, Hamming loss of 0.002, and F1-score of 0.96 for the tweets related to the earthquake. Our model was able to extract even three- to four-word long location references which is also evident from the exact matching score of over 92\%. The findings of this paper can help in early event localization, emergency situations, real-time road traffic management, localized advertisement, and in various location-based services.},

It deals with identifying the spatially related objects in view of their physical orientation or placement with respect to each other. The concept is widely used in many fields such as Robotics, Image Caption Generation and many more such areas. In this work the focus is to gather information from multiple modalities such as Image and its corresponding Text so as to strengthen the learning process for the identification of Spatial Relation pairs from a given text. Two different multimodal approaches are proposed in this work. In the first approach, information is explored as a sequential learning process where the individual Spatial Roles are identified as connected entities, which makes the Spatial Relation retrieval easy and efficient enough. To counter the small size of the dataset along with necessity to avoid overfitting, an efficient backward propagation based Neural Network was used to classify the candidate roles and the relations. The feature selection was different for all the classification tasks. Building on the selected feature from the first approach, the second approach uses a transfer learning method that utilizes an existing image caption generation model to retrieve the vital topic based information from image which is then used for the task. Thereby both approaches used information from two modalities which are further used to train the system in the respective approach. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Precision for two of the Spatial Roles identification. This validates the advantage of using multimodal learning when compared with other partial-multimodal processes.},

  abstract = {Place is a concept that is fundamental to how we orientate and communicate space in our everyday lives. Crowd sourced social media data present a valuable opportunity to develop bottom-up inferences of places that are integral to social activities and settings. Conventional location-led approaches use a pre-defined spatial unit to associate data and space with places, which cannot capture the richness of urban places, i.e. spatial extents and their dynamic functions. This paper develops a name-led framework to overcome these limitations in using social media data to study urban places. The framework first derives place names from georeferenced Twitter data combining text mining and spatial point pattern analysis, then estimates the spatial extents by spatial clustering, and further extracts their dynamic functions with time, which makes up a complete place profile. The framework is tested on a case study in Camden borough of London and the results are evaluated through comparisons to the Foursquare Point of Interest (POI) data. This name-lead approach enables the shift from space-based analysis to place-based analysis of urban space.},

  abstract = {The availability of numerous spectral, spatial, and contextual features with object-based image analysis (OBIA) renders the selection of optimal features a time consuming and subjective process. While several feature selection methods have been used in conjunction with OBIA, a robust comparison of the utility and efficiency of approaches would facilitate broader and more effective implementation. In this study, we evaluated three feature selection methods, (1) Jeffreys{\textendash}Matusita distance (JM), (2) classification tree analysis (CTA), and (3) feature space optimization (FSO) for object-based vegetation classifications with sub-decimeter digital aerial imagery in arid rangelands of the southwestern U.S. We assessed strengths, weaknesses, and best uses for each method using the criteria of ease of use, ability to rank and/or reduce input features, and classification accuracies. For the five sites tested, JM resulted in the highest overall classification accuracies for three sites, while CTA yielded highest accuracies for two sites. FSO resulted in the lowest accuracies. CTA offered ease of use and ability to rank and reduce features, while JM had the advantage of assessing class separation distances. FSO allowed for determining features relatively quickly, because it operates within the OBIA software used in this analysis (eCognition). However, the feature ranking in FSO is not transparent and accuracies were relatively low. While all methods offered an objective approach for determining suitable features for classifications of sub-decimeter resolution aerial imagery, we concluded that CTA was best suited for this particular application. We explore the limitations, assumptions, and appropriate uses for this and other datasets.},

The network consists of 2.5 million customers that have placed 810 million communications (phone calls and text messages) over a period of 6 months and for whom we have geographical home localization information. It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k-5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d-2, where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.},

However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations, longer training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a selfsupervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

Such data can be mined to provide planners, marketers and researchers with useful information about activities and opinions across time and space. However, in their raw form, textual data are still difficult to analyse coherently and Twitter streams pose particular interpretive challenges because they are restricted to just 140 characters. This paper explores the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify geo-tagged Tweets from Inner London recorded during typical weekdays throughout 2013 into a small number of groups, following extensive text cleaning techniques. Our classification identifies 20 distinctive and interpretive topic groupings, which represent key types of Tweets, from describing activities or informal conversations between users, to the use of check-in applets. Our motivation is to use the classification to demonstrate how the nature of the content posted on Twitter varies according to the characteristics of places and users. Topics and attitudes expressed through Tweets are found to vary substantially across Inner London, and by time of day. Some observed variations in behaviour on Twitter can be attributed to the inferred demographic and socio-economic characteristics of users, but place and local activities can also exert a considerable influence. Overall, the classification was found to provide a valuable framework for investigating the content and coverage of Twitter usage across Inner London.},

Our ambition in the paper is less to dismantle notions of cognition still present in geographers' studies of map use; instead we offer the beginnings of a way of analysing ordinary practices of wayfinding that treats matters of reasoning as publicly available in gestures and conversation rather than indirectly accessible inner processes of mental map consultation. To do so we describe what occurs during two video fragments involving consultation of maps in commonplace situations. The first is a group of tourists on foot trying to find an old building in Edinburgh and the second daytrippers travelling out for a day in the countryside locating some recommended places to visit in a road atlas.},

The video data used is from a larger study of pedestrians using smartphones in urban settings, with our analysis here turning on how a smartphone is used and interacted around to accomplish walking together. Our approach draws upon ethnomethodological conversation analysis (EMCA) studies of the sequential and category-based organization of mobile and on-screen actions. The analysis shows how walking actions (such as unilateral-stopping, turning, re-starting) are connected to map actions such as displaying the map, manipulating the scale, and monitoring the movement of the you-are-here dot. We conclude with remarks on the collaborative inter-subjective nature of walking with apps.},

The scope of geographic information retrieval is to search for geographic information not against a database, but against the whole Internet: but the Internet stores information in different languages, and it is of paramount importance not to remain stuck to a unique language. In this paper, our first step is to clarify the links between geographic objects as computer representations of geographic features, ontologies and gazetteers designed in various languages. Then, we propose some inference rules for matching not only types, but also relations in geographic ontologies with the assistance of gazetteers.},

Evidence gleaned from the national evaluation of 2002/03 helps illuminate trends and tensions within three themes which have proved central to the wider urban debate: community engagement, partnership working, and the complexity of ABIs. On the broad canvas, evidence from the evaluation suggests that institutional factors continue to impinge strongly on the programme, that the original assumption that partnerships should be given a strong degree of local flexibility and freedoms has been steadily eroded, and that the initiative as a whole sits within that raft of essentially reformist policy interventions effected by the Labour government since 1997.},

  abstract = {Since its inception, Twitter has played a major role in real-world events{\textemdash}especially in the aftermath of disasters and catastrophic incidents, and has been increasingly becoming the first point of contact for users wishing to provide or seek information about such situations. The use of Twitter in emergency response and disaster management opens up avenues of research concerning different aspects of Twitter data quality, usefulness and credibility. A real challenge that has attracted substantial attention in the Twitter research community exists in the location inference of twitter data. Considering that less than 2\% of tweets are geotagged, finding location inference methods that can go beyond the geotagging capability is undoubtedly the priority research area. This is especially true in terms of emergency response, where spatial aspects of information play an important role. This paper introduces a multi-elemental location inference method that puts the geotagging aside and tries to predict the location of tweets by exploiting the other inherently attached data elements. In this regard, textual content, users' profile location and place labelling, as the main location-related elements, are taken into account. Location-name classes in three granularity levels are defined and employed to look up the location references from the location-associated elements. The inferred location of the finest granular level is assigned to a tweet, based on a novel location assignment rule. The location assigned by the location inference process is considered to be the inferred location of a tweet, and is compared with the geotagged coordinates as the ground truth of the study. The results show that this method is able to successfully infer the location of 87\% of the tweets at the average distance error of 12.2 km and the median distance error of 4.5 km, which is a significant improvement compared with that of the current methods that can predict the location with much larger distance errors or at a city-level resolution at best.},

In this paper, we are interested in extracting fine-grained locations mentioned in tweets with temporal awareness. More specifically, we like to extract each point-ofinterest (POI) mention in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited, is currently at, or will soon visit this POI. Our proposed solution, named Petar, consists of two main components: a POI inventory and a time-aware POI tagger. The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of Foursquare community. It contains not only the formal names of POIs but also the informal abbreviations. The POI tagger, based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, is designed to simultaneously identify the POIs and resolve their associated temporal awareness. In our experiments, we investigated four types of features (i.e., lexical, grammatical, geographical, and BILOU schema features) for time-aware POI extraction. With the four types of features, Petar achieves promising extraction accuracy and outperforms all baseline methods.},

  abstract = {The road extraction in urban areas is difficult task due to the complicated patterns and many contextual objects. LiDAR data directly provides three dimensional (3D) points with less occlusions and smaller shadows. The elevation information and surface roughness are distinguishing features to separate roads. However, LiDAR data has some disadvantages are not beneficial to object extraction, such as the irregular distribution of point clouds and lack of clear edges of roads. For these problems, this paper proposes an automatic road centerlines extraction method which has three major steps: (1) road center point detection based on multiple feature spatial clustering for separating road points from ground points, (2) local principal component analysis with least squares fitting for extracting the primitives of road centerlines, and (3) hierarchical grouping for connecting primitives into complete roads network. Compared with MTH (consist of Mean shift algorithm, Tensor voting, and Hough transform) proposed in our previous article, this method greatly reduced the computational cost. To evaluate the proposed method, the Vaihingen data set, a benchmark testing data provided by ISPRS for ``Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction'' project, was selected. The experimental results show that our method achieve the same performance by less time in road extraction using LiDAR data.},

However, supervised learning algorithms rely on labelled data, which is not readily available for an emerging target disaster. While labelled data might be available for a prior source disaster, supervised classifiers learned only from the source disaster may not perform well on the target disaster, as each event has unique characteristics (e.g., type, location, and culture) and may cause different social media responses. To address this limitation, we propose to use a domain adaptation approach, which learns classifiers from unlabelled target data, in addition to source labelled data. Our approach uses the Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier, together with an iterative Self-Training strategy. Experimental results on the task of identifying tweets relevant to a disaster of interest show that the domain adaptation classifiers are better as compared to the supervised classifiers learned only from labelled source data.},

The resulting ordinary differential equations can be cast into a canonical Hamiltonian system. A fully-discretized scheme is then devised by considering an average vector field method in time. Moreover, based on the fast Fourier transform and the matrix diagonalization method, a fast solver is developed to solving the resulting algebraic equations. Finally, the proposed scheme is employed to capture the blow-up phenomena of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation.},

We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a global multi-scale place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a spatiotemporal-continuous and easy-to-implement measurement. The multi-scale PCI, demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10\% penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: (1) modeling the spatial spread of COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic and (2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together with the open-sourced PCI datasets at various geographic levels, are expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.},

Specifically, we propose a two-stage training algorithm: In the first stage, we adapt the pre-trained language model to the NER tasks using the distant labels, which can significantly improve the recall and precision; In the second stage, we drop the distant labels, and propose a self-training approach to further improve the model performance. Thorough experiments on 5 benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOND over existing distantly supervised NER methods. The code and distantly labeled data have been released in https://github.com/cliang1453/BOND.},

This is not simple when the data is unstructured as is the case when the data is a collection of documents such as news articles, which is the domain of discourse, where the spatial attribute consists of text that can be (but is not required to be) interpreted as the names of locations. In other words, spatial data is specified using text (known as a toponym) instead of geometry, which means that there is some ambiguity involved. The process of identifying and disambiguating references to geographic locations is known as geotagging and involves using a combination of internal document structure and external knowledge, including a document-independent model of the audience's vocabulary of geographic locations, termed its spatial lexicon. In contrast to previous work, a new spatial lexicon model is presented that distinguishes between a global lexicon of locations known to all audiences, and an audience-specific local lexicon. Generic methods for inferring audiences' local lexicons are described. Evaluations of this inference method and the overall geotagging procedure indicate that establishing local lexicons cannot be overlooked, especially given the increasing prevalence of highly local data sources on the Internet, and will enable the construction of more accurate spatial indexes.},

In particular, geography plays a key role in the news, and enabling geographic retrieval of news articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles, which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural language. Toponym recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news articles, but these static collections do not reflect the streaming nature of online news, as evidenced by poor performance in tests. In contrast, a method for toponym recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components, both rule-based and statistical. An evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym recognition systems when tested on large datasets of streaming news, indicating its suitability for this domain.},

We show that the natural algebraic object governing this kind of calculus is a non-associative algebra (in the sense of Maddux), and that the notion of weak representation is the right notion for describing most basic properties. We discuss the ubiquity of weak representations in various guises, and argue that the fundamental notion of consistency itself can best be understood in terms of consistency of one weak representation with respect to another.},

However, most studies adopted only one single data source for measurements, which is incomplete since each source has its own limitations. There are biases and uncertainties in the connectivity results when using different data sources. To address this problem, our study proposed a novel method that could combine the advantages of multi-source data. First, we measured inter-city connectivities using several datasets individually, and then analyzed each city's node strength based on the connectivities. Next, the performance of each dataset was validated according to several correlation analyses between the node strength and various socio-economic metrics. Based on these validations, we used the genetic algorithm to search for the optimal weights for combination. Only those datasets with higher weights were retained for further calculation. The final connectivity result is more reasonable than any single result according to the validation. For the first time, this study compares different data sources related to inter-city connectivity, and combines their advantages based on selective weighted combination. The results are expected to provide strong support for large-scale regional planning. In addition, the proposed method could be further applied to other large areas for analyzing inter-city connectivities.},

Traditional address matching methods mainly focus on the literal similarity of address records and are therefore not applicable to the unstructured address data. In this study, we introduce an address matching method based on deep learning to identify the semantic similarity between address records. First, we train the word2vec model to transform the address records into their corresponding vector representations. Next, we apply the enhanced sequential inference model (ESIM), a deep text-matching model, to make local and global inferences to determine if two addresses match. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we fine-tune the model with real-world address data from the Shenzhen Address Database and compare the outputs with those of several popular address matching methods. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a higher matching accuracy for unstructured address records, with its precision, recall, and F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) reaching 0.97 on the test set.},

The basic assumption is that a higher count of co-occurrences of two geographical places implies a stronger relatedness between them. The spatial structure of China at the provincial level is explored from the co-occurrences of two provincial units in one document, extracted by a web information retrieval engine. Analysis on the co-occurrences and topological distances between all pairs of provinces indicates that: (1) spatially close provinces generally have similar co-occurrence patterns; (2) the frequency of co-occurrences exhibits a power law distance decay effect with the exponent of 0.2; and (3) the co-occurrence matrix can be used to capture the similarity/ linkage between neighboring provinces and fed into a regionalization method to examine the spatial organization of China. The proposed method provides a promising approach to extracting valuable geographical information from massive web pages.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial optical images as well as coregistered LiDAR data opens great opportunities for improving objectlevel dense semantic labeling of airborne remote sensing imagery. As a result, efficient and effective multisensor fusion techniques are needed to fully exploit these complementary data modalities. Recent researches demonstrated how to process remote sensing images using pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) at the feature level. In this paper, we propose a decision-level fusion approach using a probabilistic graphical model for the task of dense semantic labeling. Our proposed method first obtains two initial probabilistic labeling predictions from a fully-convolutional neural network and a linear classifier, e.g. logistic regression, respectively. These two predictions are then combined within a higher-order conditional random field (CRF). We utilize graph cut inference to estimate the final dense semantic labeling results. Higher-order CRF modeling helps to resolve fusion ambiguities by explicitly using the spatial contextual information, which can be learned from the training data. Experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset show that our proposed approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Road data in 3-dimensional forms is required for a variety of geospatial applications e.g. road maintenance, transport planning and location-based services. Although airborne lidar can produce dense point clouds from which 3-dimensional road information can be retrieved in detail, lidar data is often incomplete due to the line-of-sight requirement, and therefore a better result of information extraction from lidar data can be achieved if supplement data is used. This paper presents a novel algorithm for road extraction from lidar point clouds and associative vector data. A moving window-based classification technique using various cues determined from the lidar data is applied in a hierarchical way to separate road from other objects. In order to fill the gaps caused by the line-of-sight problem e.g. shadows of trees and buildings, the vector data is used in the refinement process to improve the results by including a buffer, deleting false positives, interpolating and fitting the road-representing points into polylines. To validate the proposed algorithm, four samples of lidar data sets are tested. The test result shows that it is a practical method for road extraction from airborne lidar data for both structured and unstructured lanes.},

It brings together over 20 specially commissioned chapters, written by distinguished international scholars, on a range of topics around the language/identity nexus. The collection deals sequentially with identities at various levels, both social and personal. Using detailed, empirical evidence, the chapters illustrate how the multi-layered, dynamic nature of identities is realised through linguistic behaviour. Several chapters in the volume focus on contexts in which we might expect to observe a foregrounding of factors involved in the definition and delimitation of self and other: for example, cases in which identities may be disputed, changing, blurred, peripheral, or imposed. Such a focus on complex contexts allows clearer insight into the identity-making and -marking functions of language. The collection approaches these topics from a range of perspectives, with contributions from sociolinguists, sociophoneticians, linguistic anthropologists, clinical linguists and forensic linguists.},

A simple model is used in which mortality (all-ages and premature) is the dependent variable, and deprivation, morbidity and other socio-economic indicators are the explanatory variables. Deprivation is measured by the Townsend index; the other socio-economic variables are the median income, unequal income distribution (Gini coefficient) and population density. Morbidity is estimated on the basis of hospital admission rates and overweight prevalence. Spatial autocorrelation is measured by the Moran's I coefficient. All mortality and morbidity variables have significant, positive, and moderate-to-high spatial autocorrelation. Two multivariate models are explored: a weighted least-squares model ignoring spatial autocorrelation and a simultaneous autoregressive model. The paper concludes that spatial autocorrelation has a significant impact on the relationship between mortality and socio-economic variables. Future ecological models intended to inform health resources allocation need to pay greater attention to the spatial dimension of the data used. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

The wide scope of this study leads to an original and vital method for the evaluation of city form. The architect, the planner, and certainly the city dweller will all want to read this book.},

Social media are becoming an important information input to support situational assessment (to produce awareness) in all domains. Here, we present a geovisual analytics approach to supporting SA for crisis events using one source of social media, Twitter. Specifically, we focus on leveraging explicit and implicit geographic information for tweets, on developing place-time-theme indexing schemes that support overview+detail methods and that scale analytical capabilities to relatively large tweet volumes, and on providing visual interface methods to enable understanding of place, time, and theme components of evolving situations. Our approach is user-centered, using scenario-based design methods that include formal scenarios to guide design and validate implementation as well as a systematic claims analysis to justify design choices and provide a framework for future testing. The work is informed by a structured survey of practitioners and the end product of Phase-I development is demonstrated / validated through implementation in SensePlace2, a map-based, web application initially focused on tweets but extensible to other media.},

Rarely has this involved investigating socio-economic or cultural features of areas that might influence health; usually studies use area level data, for example about specific pathogens or about levels of deprivation, as surrogates for individual level data, rather than being interested in the areas themselves. This paper reviews the literature on the relationship between area and health. It advocates directly studying features of the local social and physical environment which might promote or inhibit health, illustrating this approach with some findings from a study in the West of Scotland, and suggests that improvements in public health might be achieved by focusing on places as well as on people.},

A second aim is to track changes in real time, which we do by comparing our findings to those of the 1950s-era Survey of English Dialects (SED; Orton, 1962). We improve upon previous dialectological work by paying careful attention to the phonemic status of mergers and splits: In our contemporary data, we do this by asking subjects if they have a phonemic contrast; in the SED data, we do this by superimposing the isoglosses for individual phones. We find evidence for both stability and change; we document previously unverified patterns. Perhaps most importantly, we identify a number of directions for future research.},

There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals' immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life. Our results have informed the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and the novel geo-located experience sampling methodology we describe has great potential to provide new insights in a range of areas of interest to policymakers.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in Question Answering (QA) research and products in both academic and industry. However, geographic question answering remained nearly untouched although geographic questions account for a substantial part of daily communication. Compared to general QA systems, geographic QA has its own uniqueness, one of which can be seen during the process of handling unanswerable questions. Since users typically focus on the geographic constraints when they ask questions, if the question is unanswerable based on the knowledge base used by a QA system, users should be provided with a relaxed query which takes distance decay into account during the query relaxation and rewriting process. In this work, we present a spatially explicit translational knowledge graph embedding model called TransGeo which utilizes an edge-weighted PageRank and sampling strategy to encode the distance decay into the embedding model training process. This embedding model is further applied to relax and rewrite unanswerable geographic questions. We carry out two evaluation tasks: link prediction as well as query relaxation/rewriting for an approximate answer prediction task. A geographic knowledge graph training/testing dataset, DB18, as well as an unanswerable geographic query dataset, GeoUQ, are constructed. Compared to four other baseline models, our TransGeo model shows substantial advantages in both tasks.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised text encoding models have recently fueled substantial progress in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks. Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast, Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different scales.},

  abstract = {E-commerce customers in developing nations like India tend to follow no fixed format while entering shipping addresses. Parsing such addresses is challenging because of a lack of inherent structure or hierarchy. It is imperative to understand the language of addresses, so that shipments can be routed without delays. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards understanding customer addresses by deriving motivation from recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP). We also formulate different pre-processing steps for addresses using a combination of edit distance and phonetic algorithms. Then we approach the task of creating vector representations for addresses using Word2Vec with TF-IDF, Bi-LSTM and BERT based approaches. We compare these approaches with respect to sub-region classification task for North and South Indian cities. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of generalized RoBERTa model, pre-trained over a large address corpus for language modelling task. Our proposed RoBERTa model achieves a classification accuracy of around 90\% with minimal text preprocessing for sub-region classification task outperforming all other approaches. Once pre-trained, the RoBERTa model can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks in supply chain like pincode 1 suggestion and geo-coding. The model generalizes well for such tasks even with limited labelled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind research proposing a novel approach of understanding customer addresses in e-commerce domain by pre-training language models and fine-tuning them for different purposes.},

  abstract = {Objective: To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who are not transported to hospital after an emergency (999) call to the East Midlands Ambulance Service, the reason for non-transportation, and the priority assigned when the ambulance is dispatched. Methods: The first 500 consecutive non-transported patients from 1 March 2000 were identified from the ambulance service command and control data. Epidemiological and clinical data were then obtained from the patient report form completed by the attending ambulance crew and compared with the initial priority dispatch (AMPDS) code that determined the urgency of the ambulance response. Results: Data were obtained for 498 patients. Twenty six per cent of these calls were assigned an AMPDS delta code (the most urgent category) at the time the call was received. Falls accounted for 34\% of all non-transported calls. This group of patients were predominantly elderly people (over 70 years old) and the majority (89\%) were identified as less urgent (coded AMPDS alpha or bravo) at telephone triage. The mean time that an ambulance was committed to each non-transported call was 34 minutes. Conclusions: This study shows that falls in elderly people account for a significant proportion of nontransported 999 calls and are often assigned a low priority when the call is first received. There could be major gains if some of these patients could be triaged to an alternative response, both in terms of increasing the ability of the ambulance service to respond faster to clinically more urgent calls and improving the cost effectiveness of the health service. The AMPDS priority dispatch system has been shown to be sensitive but this study suggests that its specificity may be poor, resulting in rapid responses to relatively minor problems. More research is required to determine whether AMPDS prioritisation can reliably and safely identify 999 calls where an alternative to an emergency ambulance would be a more appropriate response.},

  abstract = {The concept of scale in human geography has been profoundly transformed over the past 20 years. And yet, despite the insights that both empirical and theoretical research on scale have generated, there is today no consensus on what is meant by the term or how it should be operationalized. In this paper we critique the dominant {\textendash} hierarchical {\textendash} conception of scale, arguing it presents a number of problems that cannot be overcome simply by adding on to or integrating with network theorizing. We thereby propose to eliminate scale as a concept in human geography. In its place we offer a different ontology, one that so flattens scale as to render the concept unnecessary. We conclude by addressing some of the political implications of a human geography without scale.},

  abstract = {Evacuations are the most effective protective strategy taken to minimize the deadly threat of an incoming hurricane. Their study has a long record in the United States, and the scientific community has achieved a significant understanding of these processes. However, there are limitations in the traditional methods of studying evacuation behavior, such as survey questionnaires and traffic counts, which sometimes fail to efficiently produce the results that emergency managers need. The development of innovative methods for the study of evacuation decision-making, such as the use of so-called Big Data analytics offers an opportunity to complement traditional approaches in evacuation behavior research as well as advancing understudied aspects of evacuation behavior. Applied to Hurricane Matthew in South Carolina and Hurricane Irma in Florida, our findings reveal that geotagged tweets provide a representative sample of individuals in the age range 18-54 years, thus complementing elderly-biased questionnaire survey samples. The combination of questionnaire and Twitter methods found no gender effect on evacuation decision-making but confirmed a significant positive association with residential status. Additionally, we observed a differential behavior of the race/ethnicity and age predictors in the two areas of study. We confirm the validity of Twitter to explore certain aspects of evacuation behavior, thus illustrating a new and rich data source for researchers in this field.},

The lidar data are used exclusively to evaluate the potential in the road extraction process. First, the SVM algorithm is used to classify the lidar data into five classes: road, tree, building, grassland, and cement. Then, some misclassified pixels in the road class is removed using the road values in the normalized Digital Surface Model and Normalized Difference Distance features. In the postprocessing stage, a method based on Radon transform and Spline interpolation is employed to automatically locate and fill the gaps in the road network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm for gap filling works well on straight roads. The proposed road extraction algorithm is tested on three datasets. An accuracy assessment indicated 63.7 percent, 60.26 percent and 66.71 percent quality for three datasets. Finally, centerline of the detected roads is extracted using mathematical morphology.},

The approach we advocate for SpRL fully exploits its kinship with SRL. It is based on adopting the NLPNET system, that is built on a multi-layer convolutional neural network and has proved its efficiency in dealing with the SRL task. We demonstrate that SpRL can be performed by a system originally designed for SRL, as well as that by applying several relatively simple input format transformations, it is possible to achieve a gain in the system's performance. We present the results for the distinct cases of static and dynamic spatial relations. Although being relatively modest, the performance demonstrated by the system is comparable with that of the known state-of-the-art systems.},

For example, the phrase a book on the shelf contains information about the location of the object book, corresponding to a trajector, with respect to the object shelf, which in turn corresponds to a landmark. Spatial role labeling concerns with the task of automatically processing textual sentences and identifying objects of spatial scenes and relations between them. In this paper, we describe the application of modern machine learning methods to extract spatial roles and their relations, specifically by adapting a pre-existing system based on a convolutional neural network architecture that has been recently proposed for the more general task of semantic role labeling. We report on experiments with datasets from the SemEval challenges on spatial role labeling, showing that our method can achieve results in line with the current state-of-the-art. We therefore argue that that spatial role labeling can leverage on recent developments in semantic role labeling, requiring only minimal adaptations.},

For example, most cities have at least one bar district defined as such by the clustering of bars within a few city blocks. In reality, it is not the presence of spatial locations labeled as bars that contribute to a bar region, but rather the popularity of the bars themselves. Following the principle that places, and by extension, placetype regions exist via the people that have given space meaning, we explore user-contributed content as a way of extracting this meaning. Kernel density estimation models of place-based social check-ins are compared to spatially tagged social posts with the goal of identifying thematic regions within the city of Los Angeles, CA. Dynamic human activity patterns, represented as temporal signatures, are included in this analysis to demonstrate how regions change over time.},

Our key accomplishments include: developing a sequential tagging approach; crafting annotation guidelines; building annotated datasets for English and Russian news; and, conducting experiments in automated detection of location phrases with both statistical and neural taggers.

  abstract = {While there is consensus that network embeddedness of cities is of great importance for their development, the precise effect is difficult to assess because of a lack of consistent information on relations between cities. This paper presents, applies and evaluates a rather novel method to establish the strength of relationships between places, a method we refer to as `the toponym co-occurrence method'. This approach builds the urban system on the basis of co-occurrences of place names in a text corpus. We innovate by exploiting a so far unparalleled amount of data, namely the billions of web pages contained in the commoncrawl web archive, and by applying the method also to small places that tend to be ignored by other methods. The entire settlement system of the Netherlands is consequently explored. In addition, we innovatively apply machine learning techniques to classify these relations. Much attention is paid to solving biases deriving from place name disambiguation. Gravity modelling is employed to assess the resulting spatial organization of the Netherlands. It turns out that the gravity model fits very well with the pattern of relationships between places as found in digital space, which contributes to our assessment that the toponym co-occurrence method is a solid proxy for relationships in real space. Using the method, it is established that the relationships in the Randstad region, by many considered a coherent metropolitan entity, are actually somewhat less strong than expected. In contrast, historically important, but nowadays small cities in the periphery tend to have maintained their prominent position in the pattern of relationships. Suburban, relatively new places in the shadow of a larger city tend to be weakly related to other places. Several suggestions to further improve the method, in particular the classification of relationships, are discussed.},

This work seeks the GIS update starting from color images and using preexisting vectorial information. As input data only the RGB bands of a satellite or aerial color image of high resolution is required. The system includes four different modules: data preprocessing; binary segmentation based on three levels of texture statistical evaluation; automatic vectorization by means of skeletal extraction; and finally a module for system evaluation. In the first module the color image is rectified and geo-referenced. The second module uses a new technique, named Texture Progressive Analysis (TPA), in order to obtain the segmented binary image. The TPA technique is developed in the evidence theory framework, and it consists in fusing information streaming from three different sources for the image. In the third module the obtained binary image is vectorized using an algorithm based on skeleton extraction techniques and morphological methods. The result is an extracted road network which is defined as a structural set of elements geometrically and topologically corrects. The fourth module is an evaluation of the procedure using a popular method. Experimental results show that this method is efficient in extracting and defining road networks from high resolution satellite and aerial imagery.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a dialectical interpretation of place. It argues that much of the confusion in the literature on place stems from its failure to engage with the ontological nature of place. This has led to much research implicitly accepting a restrictive Cartesian view of socio-spatial reality. Entrikin's (1991) 'betweenness of place' thesis is a notable recent illustration. In this paper I suggest that the problematic nature of place and its relationship to space can be resolved through a dialectical mode of argumentation. The spatialized dialectic of Henri Lefebvre offers a fruitful framework for reconciling the interaction between place and space insofar as it strives to overcome dualistic conceptions of capitalist spatiality. Lefevbre's dialectical approach will be counterposed to Entrikin's argument. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the respective perspectives for robust place theorization and place politics.},

  abstract = {In this paper I challenge the obsession of many Anglophone human geographers with time-space and space-time. While acknowledging that spacing and timing are important dimensions of the unfolding of many events, I question the logic of positioning them as the primordial, foundational, a priori measures for thinking about events, position, extension and context, and I suggest that their prioritisation reflects the continuing power of space and time as concepts in both classical and modern science and significant strands of philosophy. The paper traces how space and time have increasingly been thought together by human geographers since the late 1960s, examining how discussions of time-space and space-time have underpinned the writings of thinkers such as Torsten H{\"a}gerstrand, Nigel Thrift, Anthony Giddens, David Harvey and Doreen Massey. The paper draws upon strands of processual, poststructuralist and post-phenomenological thinking in an attempt to map out a different way of thinking about the unfolding of events, in which spacing and timing should not be seen a priori to be any more important than other constitutive measures {\textendash} e.g. movement, rhythm, force, energy, affect or sensation {\textendash} in the unfolding and turbulence of the world. The paper then describes how certain practices like driving and dancing may be characterised by an apprehension and inhabitation of movement-space rather than space-time.},

It is demonstrated that transportation costs explain most of the differences in food prices between producer regions and that road quality is an important factor in the transportation costs. However, food prices decrease relatively faster than transportation costs increase and traders' wages are higher on bad roads. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6\%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.},

How representative of the overall population are they?  In this paper, we take the first steps towards answering these questions by  analyzing data on a set of Twitter users representing over 1\% of the U.S. population.  We develop techniques that allow us to compare the Twitter population to the U.S. population along three axes (geography, gender, and race/ethnicity), and find that the Twitter population is a highly non-uniform sample of the population.},

The objective of this work is to propose a method for establishing a processing chain to support the geoparsing and geocoding of text documents describing events strongly linked with space and with a frequent use of fine-grain toponyms. The geoparsing part is a Natural Language Processing approach which combines the use of part of speech and syntactico-semantic combined patterns (cascade of transducers). However, the real novelty of this work lies in the geocoding method. The geocoding algorithm is unsupervised and takes profit of clustering techniques to provide a solution for disambiguating the toponyms found in gazetteers, and at the same time estimating the spatial footprint of those other fine-grain toponyms not found in gazetteers. The feasibility of the proposal has been tested with a corpus of hiking descriptions in French, Spanish and Italian.},

For certain sections of society such as the less well-off, children and teenagers and the elderly the impact is felt most strongly when local shops, schools and medical services are withdrawn in favour of larger units in distant towns. The book reviews the process of decline which led to this situation and considers the concept of accessibility to show how it can be developed into an analytical tool for measuring the success or failure of alternative policies. Each policy option is discussed in detail: the support of conventional bus or other transport services; the provision of mobile services; `mini-outlet' policies and the long-term restructuring of the rural settlement pattern.},

However, creating and maintaining gazetteers is still a complex task. Even though some online gazetteers provide rich sets of geographic names in planetary scale (e.g. GeoNames), other sources must be used to recognize references to urban locations, such as street names, neighborhood names or landmarks. We propose integrating Linked Data sources to create a gazetteer that combines a broad coverage of places with urban detail, including content on geographic and semantic relationships involving places, their multiple names and related non-geographic entities. Our final goal is to expand the possibilities for recognizing, disambiguating and filtering references to places in texts for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and related applications. The resulting ontological gazetteer, named LoG (Linked OntoGazetteer), is accessible through Web services by applications and research initiatives on GIR, text processing, named entity recognition and others. The gazetteer currently contains over 13 million places, 140 million attributes and relationships, and 4.5 million non-geographic entities. Data sources include GeoNames, Freebase, DBPedia and LinkedGeoData, which is based on OpenStreetMap data. An analysis on how these datasets overlap and complement one another is also presented.},

However, due to recent innovations, this definition can now be expanded to include `and/or from a range of public sensors, typically connected via the Internet.' A large and increasing amount of data is now being obtained from a huge variety of non-traditional sources {\textendash} from smart phone sensors to amateur weather stations to canvassing members of the public. Some disciplines (e.g. astrophysics, ecology) are already utilizing crowdsourcing techniques (e.g. citizen science initiatives, web 2.0 technology, low-cost sensors), and while its value within the climate and atmospheric science disciplines is still relatively unexplored, it is beginning to show promise. However, important questions remain; this paper introduces and explores the wide-range of current and prospective methods to crowdsource atmospheric data, investigates the quality of such data and examines its potential applications in the context of weather, climate and society. It is clear that crowdsourcing is already a valuable tool for engaging the public, and if appropriate validation and quality control procedures are adopted and implemented, it has much potential to provide a valuable source of high temporal and spatial resolution, real-time data, especially in regions where few observations currently exist, thereby adding value to science, technology and society.},

  abstract = {There are trends towards centralising hospital care within the NHS, for many excellent reasons. Yet this has a disproportionate  impact upon those patients who live at a distance from their hospital, and this impact has not been well reported or researched, but  studies have demonstrated that the utilisation of services is inversely related to the distance of the patient from the hospital; so-called  `distance decay'. This article examines the trend and describes the reasons for it, and the impact on those living in remote and rural  communities. It argues that health service planning needs to be patient centred, and points out that, although providing services to  rural communities is more expensive than that for urban populations, a balance needs to be struck between cost-effectiveness and  the provision of accessible and equitable services for all of our patients. It argues for a debate to help define where that balance point  should be, and makes certain recommendations. This debate is especially important, because the professions urgently need to decide},

  abstract = {Taylor's interlocking specification of the world city network has offered researchers a theoretically informed way to measure the world city network using readily available firm location data. However, the number and size of firms that are viewed as linking cities to one another impose a form of structural determinism on the world city network. Specifically, when a relatively small number of firms is used to define a network among a relatively large set of cities, or when only larger firms are used, this approach is unable to reveal a wide range of structures features that may actually be present in the world city network it is intended to measure. Through a series of examples, I demonstrate how specific features of firm location data predetermine the structure, number and size of cliques, and density of world city networks derived using the interlocking approach. Concluding comments discuss the implications of this structural determinism by focusing on the case of the commonly used Globalization and World Cities data set 11, offer some suggestions concerning how the interlocking approach can be employed while avoiding structural determinism, and identify some alternative approaches to mapping the world city network. El modelo interconexi{\'o}n cerrada (interlocking) de la red mundial de ciudades (world city network) desarrollado por Taylor (2001) ha proporcionado a los investigadores un marco te{\'o}rico para medir dicha red con datos f{\'a}cilmente disponibles acerca de la localizaci{\'o}n de empresas. Sin embargo, el n{\'u}mero y tama{\~n}o de las empresas que son consideradas como `vinculadoras' (de ciudades) imponen una forma de determinismo estructural sobre la red. En concreto, cuando un n{\'u}mero relativamente peque{\~n}o de firmas es utilizado para definir la red entre un conjunto relativamente grande de ciudades, o, cuando s{\'o}lo se utilizan las empresas m{\'a}s grandes, este enfoque (interlocking) no es capaz de identificar o medir una amplia gama de caracter{\'i}sticas estructurales presentes potencialmente en la red de ciudades mundiales. A trav{\'e}s de una serie de ejemplos, el autor demuestra c{\'o}mo varias caracter{\'i}sticas espec{\'i}ficas de los datos de localizaci{\'o}n de las empresas predeterminan la estructura, n{\'u}mero y tama{\~n}o de los cliques y la densidad de las redes de ciudades mundiales resultantes de la aplicaci{\'o}n de modelos de interlocking. Luego el autor presenta las implicancias del determinismo estructural mencionado, centr{\'a}ndose en el caso la base de datos de uso com{\'u}n GaWC \# 11. Finalmente el articulo ofrece algunas sugerencias sobre c{\'o}mo el enfoque de interlocking puede ser empleado sin caer en un determinismo estructural, y se identifican algunos enfoques alternativos para el mapeo de la red mundial de ciudades. 泰勒（2001）采用相对容易获得的公司地理位置数据提出的世界城市网络连锁度量方法，为研究者提供了一种理论途径。然而，将公司的数量和规模视为城市之间的联接是一种强加的世界城市网络结构决定论形式。特别是当用数量相对较少的公司或仅用大公司的数量来定义相对较大的城市网络集时，该方法不能揭示目前实际情况中大范围世界城市网络需要度量的结构特征。通过一系列的案例分析，本文显示了公司区位数据的特有特征预先决定了集团的结构、数量和规模，以及由泰勒的连锁方法推导出世界城市网络的密度。最后，通过曾被广泛采用的GaWC（全球化和世界城市）数据集的11个城市公司数据讨论了结构决定方法的应用，并就应用该方法如何避免结构决定论提出一些建议，进而识别一些可选用的方法来绘制世界城市网络图。},

However, time-critical analysis of big crisis data on social media streams brings challenges to machine learning techniques, especially the ones that use supervised learning. The scarcity of labeled data, particularly in the early hours of a crisis, delays the learning process. Existing classification methods require a significant amount of labeled data specific to a particular event for training plus a lot of feature engineering to achieve best results. In this work, we introduce neural network based classification methods for identifying useful tweets during a crisis situation. At the onset of a disaster when no labeled data is available, our proposed method makes the best use of the out-of-event data and achieves good results.},

Concerns have been raised that this could increase the risk of death. We aimed to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality in patients with lifethreatening emergencies. Methods: We undertook an observational cohort study of 10 315 cases transported with a potentially lifethreatening condition (excluding cardiac arrests) by four English ambulance services to associated acute hospitals, to determine whether distance to hospital was associated with mortality, after adjustment for age, sex, clinical category and illness severity. Results: Straight-line ambulance journey distances ranged from 0 to 58 km with a median of 5 km, and 644 patients died (6.2\%). Increased distance was associated with increased risk of death (odds ratio 1.02 per kilometre; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p,0.001). This association was not changed by adjustment for confounding by age, sex, clinical category or illness severity. Patients with respiratory emergencies showed the greatest association between distance and mortality. Conclusion: Increased journey distance to hospital appears to be associated with increased risk of mortality. Our data suggest that a 10-km increase in straight-line distance is associated with around a 1\% absolute increase in mortality.},

Negative binomial count data models were used to analyze the associations between these factors with traffic fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries. Results suggest that urbanized areas are associated with fewer casualties (especially fatalities) while areas of higher employment density are associated with more casualties. More deprived areas tend to have higher levels of casualties, though not of motorized casualties (except slight injuries).

To address this, we nuance the theoretical discussion and extend the empirical research, analyzing the spatial cocreative artmaking process through video interviews with eighteen Finnish artists using AI. Drawing on the work of Barad, we regard humans and AI as fundamentally entwined, receiving their agencies through intra-action. Building on this, we demonstrate how the agencies of artists and AI emerge and mutually evolve across three stages of the creative process: (1) coding and data, (2) learning and training, and (3) curating the outcome. Thus, through our empirical research on how artist and AI create new material and meaningful artworlds, we are able to nuance understanding of coagency as a spatial process.

Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy {\textemdash} our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6\%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 5\%.},

  abstract = {We automatically create enormous, free and multilingual silver-standard training annotations for named entity recognition (ner) by exploiting the text and structure of Wikipedia. Most ner systems rely on statistical models of annotated data to identify and classify names of people, locations and organisations in text. This dependence on expensive annotation is the knowledge bottleneck our work overcomes. We first classify each Wikipedia article into named entity (ne) types, training and evaluating on 7200 manually-labelled Wikipedia articles across nine languages. Our cross-lingual approach achieves up to 95\% accuracy. We transform the links between articles into ne annotations by projecting the target article's classifications onto the anchor text. This approach yields reasonable annotations, but does not immediately compete with existing gold-standard data. By inferring additional links and heuristically tweaking the Wikipedia corpora, we better align our automatic annotations to gold standards. We annotate millions of words in nine languages, evaluating English, German, Spanish, Dutch and Russian Wikipedia-trained models against conll shared task data and other gold-standard corpora. Our approach outperforms other approaches to automatic ne annotation (Richman and Schone, 2008 [61], Mika et al., 2008 [46]) competes with gold-standard training when tested on an evaluation corpus from a different source; and performs 10\% better than newswire-trained models on manually-annotated Wikipedia text.},

  abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the role of ambulance response times in improving survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods OHCAs were identified by sampling consecutive life-threatening category A emergency ambulance calls on an annual basis for the 5 years 1996/ 7e2000/1 from four ambulance services in England. From these, all calls where an ambulance arrived at the scene and treated or transported a patient were included in the study. These cohorts of patients were followed up to discharge from hospital. Results Overall, 30 (2.6\%) of the 1161 patients with cardiac arrest survived to hospital discharge. If the patient arrested while the paramedics were on scene, survival to hospital discharge was 14\%. The most important predictive factors for survival were response time, initial presenting heart rhythm in ventricular fibrillation and whether the arrest was witnessed. The estimated effect of a 1 min reduction in response time was to improve the odds of survival by 24\% (95\% CI 4\% to 48\%). The costs of reducing response times across the board by 1 min at the time of this study were estimated at around {\pounds}54 million. Conclusions The arrival of a crew prior to OHCA means that the chance of surviving the arrest increases sevenfold. Overall it is possible that rapid response to patients in immediate risk of arrest may be at least as beneficial as rapid response to those who have arrested. Concentrating resources on reducing response times across the board to improve survival for those patients already in arrest is unlikely to be a cost-effective option to the UK National Health Service.},

In such a context taking into account the societal gender structure (public policies, family-level gender relations) explicitly can enhance our understanding of contemporary fertility trends. In this paper we study the second birth, given its increasing importance in the developed world as large proportions of women remain childless or bear only one child. We focus on Sweden where gender equality is pronounced at both the societal and the family level and on Hungary where the dual-earner model has been accompanied by traditional gender relations in the home sphere. Our analysis is based on data extracted from the Swedish and Hungarian Fertility and Family Surveys of 1992/93. We use the method of hazard regression. The results suggest that the secondbirth intensity increases as the combination of parenthood and labor-force attachment of either parent is facilitated. We see this in the effect of family policies in Sweden and in the higher second-birth intensity of couples who share family responsibilities as compared to those with traditional gender-role behavior in both countries. Also, the lack of any visible impact of men's educational attainment in both Sweden and Hungary is probably linked to public policies as state support for families with children has reduced the importance of income for second childbearing. A positive educational gradient for Swedish women and an essentially zero gradient in Hungary reflects the success of policy measures in reducing fertility cost for more educated women in both countries.},

We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities. These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and spatial constraints.},

It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques.

We are interested in the similarities or differences between different Geo-Social Media in the description of places.

Particularly, we took places extracted through spatio-temporal clustering from one data source (Twitter) and examined whether their structure is reflected semantically in another data set (Flickr). Based on that, we analyse how the semantic similarity between places varies over space and scale, and how Tobler's first law of geography holds with regards to scale and places.},

  abstract = {Geographic information retrieval (GIR) is concerned with returning information in response to an information need, typically expressed in terms of a thematic and spatial component linked by a spatial relationship. However, evaluation initiatives have often failed to show significant differences between simple text baselines and more complex spatially enabled GIR approaches. We explore the effectiveness of three systems (a text baseline, spatial query expansion, and a full GIR system utilizing both text and spatial indexes) at retrieving documents from a corpus describing mountaineering expeditions, centred around fine grained toponyms. To allow evaluation, we use user generated content (UGC) in the form of metadata associated with individual articles to build a test collection of queries and judgments. The test collection allowed us to demonstrate that a GIRbased method significantly outperformed a text baseline for all but very specific queries associated with very small query radii. We argue that such approaches to test collection development have much to offer in the evaluation of GIR.},

Later, when Robert Chambers and others introduced maps into Participatory Rural Appraisal, Participatory GIS and Public Participation GIS were also recognized by quantitative geographers as research methods and visualization tools. In the era of smartphones and global Internet coverage, applications such as FixMyStreet, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB and Maptioannaire allow users to cross the technology gap and become neocartographers without the need for GIS knowledge. GeoParticipation based on using spatial tools in order to involve citizens in community participation can be the future development of Public Participation GIS as it provides an easy-to-use environment and social engagement while creating the feeling of belonging to a certain social group or community. The paper presents a historical review of participatory approaches to the creation of maps, while focusing on the changing role of citizens; from being the objects of geographical research to being the creators of the agenda as well as decision-makers within their communities. Maps were always used as tools of power, but there is a visible shift in the (map) power structures, from maps created by experts and state administration representatives towards maps created by people and their users.},

  abstract = {The recent rise in the use of social networks has resulted in an abundance of information on different aspects of everyday social activities that is available online. In the process of analysis of identifying the information originating from social networks, and especially Twitter, an important aspect is that of the geographic coordinates, i.e., geolocalisation, of the relevant information. Geolocalized information can be used by a variety of applications in order to offer better, or new services. However, only a small percentage of the twitter posts are geotagged, which restricts the applicability of location-based applications. In this work, we describe TweeLoc, our prototype system for geolocalizing tweets that are not geotagged, which can effectively estimate the tweet location at the level of a city neighborhood. TweeLoc employs a dashboard that visualizes the social activity of the geographic regions specified by the user, and provides relevant easy-to-access statistics. Moreover, it displays information on the way that these statistics evolve over time. Our system can help end-users and large-scale event organizers to better plan and manage their activities, and can complete this task fast and more accurately than alternative solutions that we compare to.},

One such use for this information is to enable the study of vernacular regions: informal places referred to on a day-to-day basis, but with no official entry in geographical resources, such as gazetteers. Past work in automatically extracting geographical information from the web to support the creation of vernacular regions has tended to focus on larger regions (e.g. The British Midlands and The South of France). In this paper we report the results of preliminary work to investigate the success of using a simple geotagging approach and resources of varying granularity from the Ordnance Survey to extract geographical information from web pages. We find that the data gathered for smaller regions (compared with larger ones) is more fine-grained which has an effect on the type of resource most useful for geo-tagging and its success.},

This paper examines how the key concepts of PPAs and ASs have evolved, how they have been applied, what issues need to be resolved, and potential areas for future research. The review begins with the main theoretical developments influencing the applied use of these methods, and continues with a categorization of the literature across three dimensions {\textemdash} research domain, methods of calculation and application purpose. We find that the methods have been used not only in the core originating fields of travel behaviour and transport geography, but also in health, criminology and demography, and are growing fastest in health. The methods have been applied to a number of purposes with applications to accessibility the most common and the fastest growing. Demonstrated interest in these methods, along with the technologies and data to facilitate them, suggests a bright future for the use of PPAs and ASs in the social sciences.},

The irruption of Social Media and its microblogging services has produced an unprecedented wealth of content, mainly informal text generated by users, opening new opportunities for linguists to extend their studies of language variation. Previous work on automatic detection of regionalisms depended mostly on word frequencies. In this work, we present a novel metric based on Information Theory that incorporates user frequency. We tested this metric on a corpus of Argentinian Spanish tweets in two ways: via manual annotation of the relevance of the retrieved terms, and also as a feature selection method for geolocation of users. In either case, our metric outperformed other techniques based solely in word frequency, suggesting that measuring the amount of users that produce a word is informative. This tool has helped lexicographers discover several unregistered words of Argentinian Spanish, as well as different meanings assigned to registered words.},

We use case studies in Bolivia's forests and Athens, USA to explore how integrating these concepts can guide empirical research. This article argues that a more robust and explicit notion of `relational place-making'{\textendash} the networked, political processes of place-framing {\textendash} positions the concept of place in a way that offers new analytical utility for political and urban geographic scholars.},

State-of-the-art results have been recently achieved using language models trained from scratch on corpora made up exclusively of tweets, in order to better handle the Twitter jargon. This work aims to introduce a different approach for Twitter sentiment analysis based on two steps. Firstly, the tweet jargon, including emojis and emoticons, is transformed into plain text, exploiting procedures that are language-independent or easily applicable to different languages. Secondly, the resulting tweets are classified using the language model BERT, but pre-trained on plain text, instead of tweets, for two reasons: (1) pre-trained models on plain text are easily available in many languages, avoiding resource- and time-consuming model training directly on tweets from scratch; (2) available plain text corpora are larger than tweetonly ones, therefore allowing better performance. A case study describing the application of the approach to Italian is presented, with a comparison with other Italian existing solutions. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the approach and indicate that, thanks to its general basis from a methodological perspective, it can also be promising for other languages.},

It is also well known that participation in regular physical activity generates physical and psychological health benefits. The authors have hypothesised that `green exercise' will improve health and psychological well-being, yet few studies have quantified these effects. This study measured the effects of 10 green exercise case studies (including walking, cycling, horse-riding, fishing, canal-boating and conservation activities) in four regions of the UK on 263 participants. Even though these participants were generally an active and healthy group, it was found that green exercise led to a significant improvement in self-esteem and total mood disturbance (with anger-hostility, confusion-bewilderment, depression-dejection and tension-anxiety all improving post-activity). Self-esteem and mood were found not to be affected by the type, intensity or duration of the green exercise, as the results were similar for all 10 case studies. Thus all these activities generated mental health benefits, indicating the potential for a wider health and well-being dividend from green exercise. Green exercise thus has important implications for public and environmental health, and for a wide range of policy sectors.},

However, increasing amounts of data in the form of unstructured text are available for indexing and retrieval that also contain spatial references. This monograph describes the field of Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) that seeks to develop spatially-aware search systems and support user's geographical information needs. Important concepts with respect to storing, querying and analysing geographical information in computers are introduced, before user needs and interaction in the context of GIR are explored. The task of associating documents with coordinates, prior to their indexing and ranking forms the core of any GIR system, and different approaches and their implications are discussed. Evaluating the resulting systems and their components, and different paradigms for doing so continue to be an important area of research in GIR and are illustrated through several examples. The monograph provides an overview of the research field, and in so doing identifies key remaining research challenges in GIR.},

  abstract = {As an effective organization form of geographic information, a geographic knowledge graph (GeoKG) facilitates numerous geography-related analyses and services. The completeness of triplets regarding geographic knowledge determines the quality of GeoKG, thus drawing considerable attention in the related domains. Mass unstructured geographic knowledge scattered in web texts has been regarded as a potential source for enriching the triplets in GeoKGs. The crux of triplet extraction from web texts lies in the detection of key phrases indicating the correct geo-relations between geo-entities. However, the current methods for key-phrase detection are ineffective because the sparseness of the terms in the web texts describing geo-relations results in an insufficient training corpus. In this study, an unsupervised context-enhanced method is proposed to detect geo-relation key phrases from web texts for extracting triplets. External semantic knowledge is introduced to relieve the influence of the sparseness of the georelation description terms in web texts. Specifically, the contexts of geo-entities are fused with category semantic knowledge and word semantic knowledge. Subsequently, an enhanced corpus is generated using frequency-based statistics. Finally, the geo-relation key phrases are detected from the enhanced contexts using the statistical lexical features from the enhanced corpus. Experiments are conducted with real web texts. In comparison with the well-known frequency-based methods, the proposed method improves the precision of detecting the key phrases of the geo-relation description by approximately 20\%. Moreover, compared with the well-defined geo-relation properties in DBpedia, the proposed method provides quintuple key-phrases for indicating the geo-relations between geo-entities, which facilitate the generation of new triplets from web texts.},

First, we develop a word-level attention mechanism to distinguish the importance of each individual word in a sentence, increasing the attention weights for those critical words. Second, we investigate the semantic information from word embeddings of target entities, which can be developed as a supplementary feature for the extractor.

  abstract = {Sharing "location" information on social media became commonplace since the advent of smartphones. Location-based social networks introduced a derivative form of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) known as Social Location Sharing (SLS). It consists of claiming "I am/was at that Place". Since SLS represents a singular form of place-based (i.e. platial) communication, we argue that SLS data are more platial than locational. According to our data classification of VGI, locational data (e.g. a geotagged tweet which geographic dimension is limited to its coordinate information) are a reduced form of platial data (e.g. a Swarm check-in). Therefore, we believe these two kinds of data should not be analyzed on the same spatial level. This distinction needs to be clarified because a large part of geosocial data (i.e. spatial data published from social media) tends to be analyzed on the basis of a locational equivalence and not on a platial one.},

Here we evaluate the use of a spatial role labelling procedure to distinguish geospatial uses of prepositions from other spatial and non-spatial uses and experiment with the use of additional machine learning features to improve the quality of detection of geospatial prepositions. An annotated corpus of nearly 2000 instances of preposition usage was created for training and testing the classifiers.},

  abstract = {In modern GIS applications, flow mapping and geodynamics are not particularly well represented. This is somewhat surprising given the potential of such approaches to shed light on the spatial characteristics associated with the movement of people and goods. Despite the attention of a select number of researchers whose contributions have been significant, however, the subject matter remains underdeveloped and the full potential of spatial interaction data remains largely unrealised. Therefore, this paper represents an attempt to popularise the use of flow mapping within a contemporary GIS, with a view to aiding and enhancing decision support at a range of different spatial scales. It discusses advances in flow mapping, proposes an approach to mapping a large migration matrix from the United Kingdom's 2001 census, and considers the ways in which this can add value to the understanding of geographical patterns of residential mobility. Subsequently, it considers possible dissemination methods via new developments in webbased geospatial technologies before offering some general principles and identifying future challenges. The findings indicate that it is now entirely feasible to map large spatial interaction datasets with common GIS software, that this has the benefit of producing instant, query-led information, and that the knowledge derived from this could be used to inform all kinds of local, regional and national policy formulation and evaluation.},

Points of interest are the basis for most of the data supporting location-based applications. In this paper we propose to curate POIs from online sources by bootstrapping training data from Web snippets, seeded by POIs gathered from social media. This large corpus is used to train a sequential tagger to recognize mentions of POIs in text. Using Wikipedia data as the training data, we can identify POIs in free text with an accuracy that is 116\% better than the state of the art POI identifier in terms of precision, and 50\% better in terms of recall. We show that using Foursquare and Gowalla checkins as seeds to bootstrap training data from Web snippets, we can improve precision between 16\% and 52\%, and recall between 48\% and 187\% over the state-of-theart. The name of a POI is not sufficient, as the POI must also be associated with a set of geographic coordinates. Our method increases the number of POIs that can be localized nearly three-fold, from 134 to 395 in a sample of 400, with a median localization accuracy of less than one kilometer.},

We tested our method on the largest non-Internet human network, inferred from a large telecommunications database in Great Britain. Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland.},

Moreover, the mobile phone's enormous and enthusiastic adoption across most socioeconomic strata makes it a uniquely useful tool for conducting large-scale, representative behavioural research. In this paper we attempt to connect telecoms usage data from Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) to a geography of human activity derived from data on commercial premises advertised through Pagine Gialle, the Italian `Yellow Pages'. We then employ eigendecomposition {\"o}a process similar to factoring but suitable for this complex dataset {\"o}to identify and extract recurring patterns of mobile phone usage. The resulting eigenplaces support the computational and comparative analysis of space through the lens of telecommuniations usage and enhance our understanding of the city as a `space of flows'.},

String similarity measures can mitigate this problem, but given their task-dependent performance, the optimal choice of measure is unclear. We constructed a task in which place names had to be matched to variants of those names listed in the GEOnet Names Server, comparing 21 different measures on datasets containing romanized toponyms from 11 different countries. Best-performing measures varied widely across datasets, but were highly consistent within-country and within-language.

  abstract = {This paper looks at demand issues in gentrification. It takes as its basic proposition that everyone involved in the demand side belongs to the same economic class and therefore possesses the same set of motivations; that `otherness' in gentrification is something that needs to be problematised rather than assumed. It argues that the presumption of otherness arises because accounts of demand for gentrification begin at the end, from achieved housing situation, and argue back, rather than at the beginning, with means. The motivations of gentrifiers, suburbanites and displacees are the same, a concern for defining and preserving identity in the modern world: what differ between them are the means at the disposal of each group. Concern with identity means taking seriously the importance of fashion in gentrification: gentrifiers and suburbanites are members of different status groups, using housing as status symbols to define and claim membership of those groups. Displacees are just as concerned with the maintenance of their identity, but do not have access to the same amount of resources as gentrifiers. Because the solution to the gentrifiers' identity crisis takes place at the expense of the displacee, gentrification takes on a synecdochal quality: the concerns expressed in struggles over gentrification exemplify the general concern with identity in conditions of modernity, which should be understood as the subjective experience of everyday life within a capitalist mode of production. The context within which these struggles over status take place is nonetheless class-constituted and class-laden. Gentrification and the struggles it engenders should be interpreted as a form of hegemonic practice. Ultimately, it is this that makes gentrification `gentrification'.},

They also enable those watching from afar to express their sympathy and solidarity with the victims. Perhaps the most well known of these has been \#PorteOuverte (translated into English as ``Open Door''), first used during the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris before re-emerging during subsequent atrocities in Brussels (March 2016) and Nice (July 2016). The hashtag was originally created by journalist Sylvain Lapoix in order to connect those in Paris looking for somewhere to stay with those able to offer them refuge, before reaching an international audience courtesy of its amplification by public figures and citizens based overseas. This article adds to this emergent literature by analyzing the networked gatekeeping dynamics of \#PorteOuverte during the Paris terror attacks. It does so by reviewing the literature on Twitter hashtags and acute crisis events, exploring how Twitter was used during the Paris terror attacks, and presenting the results of a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of 399,256 \#PorteOuverte tweets posted as the attacks unfolded on 13 November 2015. Results indicate that professional journalists were key broadcasters during four identified peaks within \#PorteOuverte, helping to promote the informational hashtag and connect those directly affected. However, citizens and bloggers played an increasingly important gatekeeping function in the aftermath of events such as the Bataclan siege in Paris.},

Automatic recognition of location names in texts is usually solved through Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. Most current NER are based on Machine Learning and have very high accuracy in detection of location entities in digital documents, especially if the texts are in English due to the lack of available annotated corpora in other languages. However, recent studies are dealing with the challenge of taking the output labels of a NER system and then gather, from a gazetteer, their exact unambiguous geographical coordinates. This is challenging mainly because toponyms use to be very ambiguous, so research in disambiguation methods is relevant. In this paper we describe some of the main ideas towards a method to associate locations with geographical data removing possible confusion between entities with the same name. So far, we have already accomplished Geographic NER and coordinates retrieval but the main research is still in course. We largely discuss about the state of the art around Geoparsing; we explain how our Geographic Entity Recognition module works and finally we describe the research proposal focusing in ambiguity detection.},

  abstract = {In the context of spatial analysis, spatial disaggregation or spatial downscaling are processes by which information at a coarse spatial scale is translated to finer scales, while maintaining consistency with the original dataset. Fine-grained descriptions of geographical information is a key resource in fields such as social-economic studies, urban and regional planning, transport planning, or environmental impact analysis. One such method for spacial disaggregation is the dissever algorithm, a hybrid approach that combines pycnophylactic interpolation and regression-based dasymetric mapping, leveraging auxiliary data to increase desegregation precision. Implemented in R, the current dissever version assumes a sequential execution model and the usage of smaller-than-ram computational sequences, limiting the resolution and scale of usable datasets. This paper presents a variant of the dissever algorithm, called S-Dissever (Scalable Dissever) suitable for efficiently executing in parallel environments, taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures, while using secondary memory to scale out computations that exceed RAM capacity. Experimental evaluations on the S-Dissever demonstrate the feasibility of the desegregation procedure while using high-resolution auxiliary data at significant geographical extents, as well as notable speedups obtained by the utilization of multi-core environments.},

  abstract = {This study is situated within the international literature on geographic health inequalities between urban and rural areas. Using data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (ONS LS), this paper assesses the role of residential mobility within England between 1981 and 2001 in explaining geographic inequalities in all-cause mortality between urban and rural Local Authority Districts at the end of the period (deaths occurring between 2001 and 2005). First, the pattern of directly age-standardised death rates (2001e2005) in urban and rural areas of residence in 2001 is examined and compared with the pattern that would have been seen if the observed death/survival of individuals had occurred in their original place of residence in 1981, or in 1991. Secondly, logistic regression is applied to examine whether individuals' residential mobility between urban and rural areas predict the risk of mortality, adjusting for people's socio-demographic characteristics. Findings show that, for this sample, residential mobility 1981e2001 accounts for about 30\% of the urbanerural inequalities in mortality observed at the end of the period. LS members who were residentially mobile between urban and rural areas were relatively healthier than long-term urban residents, with better mortality outcomes among rural in-migrants. In age-stratified analysis, LS members of working age (20e64 years) moving out of rural areas, and LS members of retirement age (65 years and older) moving into rural areas, were shown to be healthier. Processes of selective migration in and out of rural areas in England are complex and may partly explain urbanerural health inequalities. In terms of varying mortality risk, findings also highlight the possible marginalisation and disadvantage of sub-groups of the rural population.},

This paper describes the Making Sense of Microposts (\#Microposts2015) Workshop's Named Entity rEcognition and Linking (NEEL) Challenge, held as part of the 2015 World Wide Web conference (WWW'15). The challenge task comprised automatic recognition and linking of entities appearing in different event streams of English Microposts on Twitter. Participants were set the task of investigating novel strategies for extracting entities in a tweet stream, typing these based on a set of pre-defined classes, and linking to DBpedia or NIL referents. They were also asked to implement a web service to run their systems, to minimize human involvement in the evaluation and allow measuring of processing times. The challenge attracted a lot of interest: 29 research groups expressed an intent to participate, out of which 21 signed the agreement required to be given a copy of the training and development datasets. Seven teams participated in the final evaluation of the challenge task, out of which six completed all requirements, including submission of an abstract describing their approach. The submissions covered sequential and joint linguistic methods, end-to-end and hybrid end-to-end, and linguistic approaches for tackling the challenge task. We describe the evaluation process and discuss the performance of the different approaches to the \#Microposts2015 NEEL Challenge. We also release, with this paper, the \#Microposts2015 NEEL Challenge Gold Standard, comprising the set of manually annotated tweets.},

  abstract = {Spatial information that grounds events geographically is often ambiguous, mainly because the same location name can be used in different states, countries, or continents. Spatial mentions, known as toponyms, must be disambiguated in order to understand many spatial relations within a document. Previous methods have utilized both ``flat'' and ontologybased ranking techniques to identify the correct reference. We argue that the use of location ontologies alone is not sufficient. Since toponyms are used in documents that refer to events grounded geographically, additional pragmatic knowledge can thus be used. To be able to identify the correct reference we enhanced ontology-based methods previously reported with techniques that consider the participants in events including people, organizations, and locations. Disambiguating geographical names over an ontology is cast as a probabilistic problem resolved by logistic regression. Our experimental results on the SpatialML corpus (Mani et al. 2008) indicate that event structures do indeed play an important role in understanding toponyms.},

Perhaps the most visible expression of the smart city, sensor deployment is a key equity concern. As new sensor technologies and Big Data interact with social processes, they have the potential to reproduce well-documented spatial injustices. Contrary to promises of providing new knowledge and data for cities, they can also create new gaps in understanding about specific urban populations that fall into the interstices of data collection {\textendash} sensor deserts. Building on emerging data justice debates, specifically considering distributional, recognition, and procedural forms of injustice, we conceptualise and analyse sensor deserts through two case studies, Newcastle's Urban Observatory (UK) and Chicago's Array of Things (USA). Open sensor locations are integrated with small-area, socio-economic data to evidence the demographic configuration and spatialities of sensor deserts across each city. We illustrate how the structural processes via which inequality is reinforced by smart agendas manifest as uneven social and spatial outcomes. In doing so, the paper opens up a new conceptual space in which to consider what it means (not) to count in the smart city, bringing a demographic perspective to critical debates about smart urbanisms.},

These issues raise questions about the design of spatial models used to build GIS, as well as place-based urban design methods and tools.

One common approach for geolocating texts is rooted in information retrieval. Given training documents labeled with latitude/longitude coordinates, a grid is overlaid on the Earth and pseudo-documents constructed by concatenating the documents within a given grid cell; then a location for a test document is chosen based on the most similar pseudo-document. Uniform grids are normally used, but they are sensitive to the dispersion of documents over the earth. We define an alternative grid construction using k-d trees that more robustly adapts to data, especially with larger training sets. We also provide a better way of choosing the locations for pseudo-documents. We evaluate these strategies on existing Wikipedia and Twitter corpora, as well as a new, larger Twitter corpus. The adaptive grid achieves competitive results with a uniform grid on small training sets and outperforms it on the large Twitter corpus. The two grid constructions can also be combined to produce consistently strong results across all training sets.},

This paper draws on interviews with international distance education students in Namibia and Zimbabwe studying at the University of South Africa (UNISA) to explore the spatio-temporal underpinnings to why students choose to remain at home while studying abroad and how this is arranged. It outlines the infrastructures of reach that enable student immobility and how their incomplete nature means that students have to rely on extensive systems of mobilities of other people and objects to ensure that their study progresses without their own educational mobility. In doing so we move away from considering immobility as a result of limited access to mobility. Instead, we set out a new research agenda on why and how the infrastructures of immobilities are important in mobility research.},

  abstract = {Existing empirical work has focused on assessing the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions on human mobility to contain the spread of COVID-19. Less is known about the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the spatial patterns of population movement within countries. Anecdotal evidence of an urban exodus from large cities to rural areas emerged during early phases of the pandemic across western societies. Yet, these claims have not been empirically assessed. Traditional data sources, such as censuses offer coarse temporal frequency to analyse population movement over infrequent time intervals. Drawing on a data set of 21 million observations from Meta-Facebook users, we aim to analyse the extent and evolution of changes in the spatial patterns of population movement across the rural{\textendash}urban continuum in Britain over an 18-month period from March 2020 to August 2021. Our findings show an overall and sustained decline in population movement during periods of high stringency measures, with the most densely populated areas reporting the largest reductions. During these periods, we also find evidence of higher-than-average mobility from high-density population areas to low-density areas, lending some support to claims of large-scale population movements from large cities. Yet, we show that these trends were temporary. Overall mobility levels trended back to precoronavirus levels after the easing of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Following these interventions, we found a reduction in movement to low-density areas and a rise in mobility to high-density agglomerations. Overall, these findings reveal that while COVID-19 generated shock waves leading to temporary changes in the patterns of population movement in Britain, the resulting vibrations have not significantly reshaped the prevalent structures in the national pattern of population movement. As of 2021, internal population movements sit at an intermediate level between those observed pre- and early phases of the pandemic.},

While considerable progress has been made on advancing the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of SIMs, key challenges remain to facilitate the application of SIMs, extend existing modelling approaches, and leverage the opportunities afforded by Big Data. We identify three key challenges: reproducibility, calibration and Big Data modelling. We propose a blueprint to tackle these challenges by identifying four areas of development: (1) to enable essential infrastructure to facilitate the training, calibration and reproducibility of SIMs; (2) to embrace modelling frameworks to capture spatial, temporal and population heterogeneity; (3) to enhance statistical inference to accommodate Big Data analysis; and, (4) to integrate data science approaches to enhance SIM-generated predictions and statistical inference},

  abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems have become a standard data collection technology for capturing object surface information and 3D modeling of urban areas. Although, LIDAR systems provide detailed valuable geometric information, they still require extensive interpretation of their data for object extraction and recognition to make it practical for mapping purposes. A fundamental step in the transformation of the LIDAR data into objects is the segmentation of LIDAR data through a clustering process. Nevertheless, due to scene complexity and the variety of objects in urban areas, e.g. buildings, roads, and trees, clustering using only one single cue will not reach meaningful results. The multi dimensionality nature of LIDAR data, e.g. laser range and intensity information in both first and last echo, allow the use of more information in the data clustering process and ultimately into the reconstruction scheme. Multi dimensionality nature of LIDAR data with a dense sampling interval in urban applications, provide a huge amount of valuable information. However, this amount of information produces a lot of problems for traditional clustering techniques. This paper describes the potential of an artificial swarm bee colony optimization algorithm to find global solutions to the clustering problem of multi dimensional LIDAR data in urban areas. The artificial bee colony algorithm performs neighborhood search combined with random search in a way that is reminiscent of the food foraging behavior of swarms of honey bees. Hence, by integrating the simplicity of the k-means algorithm with the capability of the artificial bee colony algorithm, a robust and efficient clustering method for object extraction from LIDAR data is presented in this paper. This algorithm successfully applied to different LIDAR data sets in different urban areas with different size and complexities.},

  abstract = {Prominence of social media such as Twitter and Facebook led to a huge collection of data over which event detection provides useful results. An important dimension of event detection is location estimation for detected events. Social media provides a variety of clues for location, such as geographical annotation from smart devices, location field in the user profile and the content of the message. Among these clues, message content needs more effort for processing, yet it is generally more informative. In this paper, we focus on extraction of location names, i.e., toponym recognition, from social media messages. We propose a a hybrid system, which uses both rule based and machine learning based techniques to extract toponyms from tweets. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is used as the machine learning tool and features such as Part-of-Speech tags and conjunction window are defined in order to construct a CRF model for toponym recognition. In the rule based part, regular expressions are used in order to define some of the toponym recognition patterns as well as to provide a simple level of normalization in order to handle the informality in the text. Experimental results show that the proposed method has higher toponym recognition ratio in comparison to the previous studies.},

However, in general, this task has been performed by human experts manually, so that it is very costly and time consuming. There have been many attempts at automating this task, but many of the existing works are based on class-specific features and classifiers. In this article, the authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based building and road extraction system. This takes raw pixel values in aerial imagery as input and outputs predicted three-channel label images (building{\textendash}road{\textendash}background). Using CNNs, both feature extractors and classifiers are automatically constructed. The authors propose a new technique to train a single CNN efficiently for extracting multiple kinds of objects simultaneously. Finally, they show that the proposed technique improves the prediction performance and surpasses state-of-the-art results tested on a publicly available aerial imagery dataset. c 2016 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.},

  abstract = {Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.},

To this day, the empirical investigation of a global multifunctional city network remains a challenge given the scarcity of appropriate relational and multifunctional data sources. To overcome this research gap, we present an interdisciplinary network modelling approach that integrates methods from geographic information science with social network analysis, including automated semantic analyses. We apply our modelling framework to a globally available, user-generated database (ie, Wikipedia), still underutilized in urban geography and planning research. The proposed visual analytical investigation of the multifunctional world city network also includes a systematic evaluation to assess the robustness of the proposed approach, and the adequacy of crowdsourced databases for scientific uses. By example, we discuss economical and political relations of a latent multifunctional global city network which we uncovered with our data-driven approach. Our results not only empirically replicate previously well-established world city network theory, but also generate new research questions about multiple functions of cities, as hypothesized in world city network research. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of coupling text-based user-generated data analysis with geovisual analytics for scientific investigations in urban studies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach to creating a polyhedral model of building roof from LiDAR point clouds using clustering techniques. A building point cloud is first separated into planar and breakline sections using the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in a small neighbourhood. The planar components from the point cloud are then grouped into small patches containing 6-8 points and their normal vector parameters are determined. The normal vectors are then clustered together to determine the principal directions of the roof planes. Directly using a clustering algorithm on normal vectors presents difficulties due to a lack of a-priori information on approximate roof directions. Therefore, a potential based approach is used iteratively with the k-means algorithm. This generates the necessary planar parameters, and segments the LiDAR roof points. For reconstruction, a plane adjacency matrix is created for the roof using the segmented roof points. Planes that intersect each other are identified and breaklines and roof vertices are generated by solving the intersecting planar equations. A vector polyhedral model of the roof is created.},

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller generalpurpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be finetuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

  abstract = {Toponym matching, i.e. pairing strings that represent the same real-world location, is a fundamental problemfor several practical applications. The current state-of-the-art relies on string similarity metrics, either specifically developed for matching place names or integrated within methods that combine multiple metrics. However, these methods all rely on common sub-strings in order to establish similarity, and they do not effectively capture the character replacements involved in toponym changes due to transliterations or to changes in language and culture over time. In this article, we present a novel matching approach, leveraging a deep neural network to classify pairs of toponyms as either matching or nonmatching. The proposed network architecture uses recurrent nodes to build representations from the sequences of bytes that correspond to the strings that are to be matched. These representations are then combined and passed to feed-forward nodes, finally leading to a classification decision. We present the results of a wide-ranging evaluation on the performance of the proposed method, using a large dataset collected from the GeoNames gazetteer. These results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform individual similarity metrics from previous studies, as well as previous methods based on supervised machine learning for combining multiple metrics.},

Finding out promptly about newsworthy events can prove extremely useful in crisis management situations. In this paper, we explore the use of Twitter as a mechanism used in disaster relief, and consequently in public safety. In particular, we perform a case study on the floods that occurred in the United Kingdom during January 2014, and how these were reflected on Twitter, according to tweets (i.e., posts) submitted by the users. We present a systematic algorithmic analysis of tweets collected with respect to our use case scenario, supplemented by visual analytic tools.

The potential of these services as the basis to gather statistics and exploit information about user behavior is appealing and, as a consequence, the number of applications developed for these purposes has been soaring. At the same time, users are now willing to share information about their location, allowing for the study of the role of geographic distance in social ties. In this paper we present a graph analysis based approach to study social networks with geographic information and new metrics to characterize how geographic distance affects social structure. We apply our analysis to four large-scale OSN datasets: our results show that there is a vast portion of users with short-distance links and that clusters of friends are often geographically close. In addition, we demonstrate that different social networking services exhibit different geo-social properties: OSNs based mainly on location-advertising largely foster local ties and clusters, while services used mainly for news and content sharing present more connections and clusters on longer distances. The results of this work can be exploited to improve many classes of systems and a potential vast number of applications, as we illustrate by means of some practical examples.},

How can these relations help us improve automated localization of places implicit in textual descriptions? In this paper, we motivate research on extraction of semantic place localization statements from text corpora which can be used for improving document retrieval and for reconstructing locations. The idea is to combine Semantic Web reasoning with existing geographic information retrieval (GIR) and structural text extraction for this purpose. GIR and Semantic Web technology have matured during the last years, but still largely exist in parallel. Current localization approaches have been focusing on the extraction of unstructured word lists from texts, including toponyms and geographic features, not on human place descriptions on a sentence level.},

  abstract = {With the ubiquity of advanced web technologies and locationsensing hand held devices, citizens regardless of their knowledge or expertise, are able to produce spatial information. This phenomenon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental monitoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is produced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods utilized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings, we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical clustering method is adopted for LIDAR image segmentation after extracting the intended features for identifying complex objects. In the experiments, four LIDAR images with different numbers of areas (sea, forest, desert, and urban) were used for examining the algorithm. The efficiency of image segmentation was generally evaluated visually because the segments of the main image typically lack certain, fixed features and depend on the criterion used for pattern distance/similarity as well as the threshold for cluster separation. For each experiment, hierarchical clustering method was employed by creating the clustering hierarchy tree and specifying the optimal number of clusters on the basis of tree data. Once the optimal number of clusters was determined, the similarity matrix of data image patterns was separated according to Euclidean distance algorithm in terms of greatest similarity among the patterns to the number of clusters. Clustering was then performed. The program output comprised labeled images for samples specifying which pattern pertains to which cluster. The images associated with each cluster are displayed separated from other clusters with other areas eliminated. The results indicated that for LIDAR images that lack a certain, fixed feature, the hierarchical clustering method for segmentation can perform separation and labeling.},

Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and on-line help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them. During emergency events, individuals are exposed to large quantities of information without being aware of their validity or risk of misinformation, but users are usually swift to correct them, thus making the social media ``self-regulating''.},

Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method. In this paper, we construct an unsupervised learning schema for the k-means algorithm so that it is free of initializations without parameter selection and can also simultaneously find an optimal number of clusters. That is, we propose a novel unsupervised k-means (Uk-means) clustering algorithm with automatically finding an optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm is also analyzed. Comparisons between the proposed U-k-means and other existing methods are made. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed U-kmeans clustering algorithm.},

  abstract = {The extraction of road network is an emerging area in information extraction from high-resolution satellite images (HRSI). It is also an interesting field that incorporates various tactics to achieve road network. The process of road detection from remote sensing images is quite complex, due to the presence of various noises. These noises could be the vehicles, crossing lines and toll bridges. Few small and large false road segments interrupt the extraction of road segments that happens due to the similar spectral behavior in heterogeneous objects. To achieve a better level of accuracy, numerous factors play their important role, such as spectral data of satellite sensor and the information related to land surface area. Therefore the interpretation varies on processing of images with different heuristic parameters. These parameters have tuned according to the road characteristics of the terrain in satellite images. There are several approaches proposed and implemented to extract the roads from HRSI comprising a single or hybrid method. This kind of hybrid approach has also improved the accuracy of road extraction in comparison to a single approach. Some characteristics related to impervious and non-impervious surfaces are used as salient features that help to improve the extraction of road area only in the correct manner. These characteristics also used to utilize the spatial, spectral and texture features to increase the accuracy of classified results. Therefore, aforesaid characteristics have been utilized in combination of road spectral properties to extract road network only with improved accuracy. This evaluated road network is quite accurate with the help of these defined methodologies.},

Moreover, an original algorithm for road extraction has been developed. This two-step method is based on the local road shape and does not rely on the presence of curbs or guardrails. Different uses of the RanSaC algorithm are employed, for road sides rough estimation in the first place, then for unlikely candidates elimination. Road boundary and center points are further processed for road width and curvature computation in order to feed a geographic information system.

  abstract = {Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of `everything geographic'. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos, choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the `natural' extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations (topos), spatial relations (choros) and topology (geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful {\textendash} some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.},

The evidence confirms that there is a clear rationale for area-based approaches, although it should not be assumed that they will be the most effective means to improve conditions in all cases. The evidence suggests that there should be a closer link between area-based approaches and national level main programmes, given the time limited nature of the former and the fact that they only reach a minority of all deprived people. The issues involved in identifying target areas are also reviewed including the question of who decides and on what basis. It is concluded that understanding the spatial distribution of deprivation is crucial and that there is an urgent need for better, more up to date statistical and other data relating to small geographical areas.},

  abstract = {Background The `deprivation amplification' hypothesis suggests that residents of deprived neighbourhoods have universally poorer access to highquality food environments, which in turn contributes to the development of spatial inequalities in diet and diet-related chronic disease. This paper presents results from a study that quantified access to grocery stores selling fresh fruit and vegetables in four environmental settings in Scotland, UK. Methods Spatial accessibility, as measured by network travel times, to 457 grocery stores located in 205 neighbourhoods in four environmental settings (island, rural, small town and urban) in Scotland was calculated using Geographical Information Systems. The distribution of accessibility by neighbourhood deprivation in each of these four settings was investigated. Results Overall, the most deprived neighbourhoods had the best access to grocery stores and grocery stores selling fresh produce. Stratified analysis by environmental setting suggests that the least deprived compared with the most deprived urban neighbourhoods have greater accessibility to grocery stores than their counterparts in island, rural and small town locations. Access to fresh produce is better in more deprived compared with less deprived urban and small town neighbourhoods, but poorest in the most affluent island communities with mixed results for rural settings. Conclusions The results presented here suggest that the assumption of a universal `deprivation amplification' hypothesis in studies of the neighbourhood food environment may be misguided. Associations between neighbourhood deprivation and grocery store accessibility vary by environmental setting.

  abstract = {Resources made available through the digital map app change, but do not replace, the skills of ``ordinary wayfinding.'' Looking at the challenges of wayfinding with new mobile devices helps inform the development of digital mapping tools for navigating through difficult terrain. With this background in mind, in this paper we consider how the contemporary navigational resources of mobile devices with GPS, and the resources of countryside landscape features, are brought together in visiting a tourist site. We analyse video data from groups walking across unfamiliar moorland terrain, following a guide and map app which takes them on a tour of a remote Roman marching camp in the Brecon Beacons National Park, Wales. Following an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic approach, we examine three instances of navigational work for paired walkers as they traverse the moorland. The three fragments are of: an orientational struggle to establish where to go next; a routine check to select a path; and the discovery of a feature mentioned in the guide. Across the three episodes we explicate how our walkers make sense of the guide and map in relation to investigating the moorland surface. We examine how their ambulatory and undulatory practices on the moorland are tied to their wayfinding practices. While we analyse wayfinding talk, we also attend to the mobile practices of stopping and pausing as part of practical navigational reasoning.},

Efforts have been made to build general purpose extractors that represent relations with their surface forms, or which jointly embed surface forms with relations from an existing knowledge graph. However, both of these approaches are limited in their ability to generalize. In this paper, we build on extensions of Harris' distributional hypothesis to relations, as well as recent advances in learning text representations (specifically, BERT), to build task agnostic relation representations solely from entity-linked text. We show that these representations significantly outperform previous work on exemplar based relation extraction (FewRel) even without using any of that task's training data. We also show that models initialized with our task agnostic representations, and then tuned on supervised relation extraction datasets, significantly outperform the previous methods on SemEval 2010 Task 8, KBP37, and TACRED.},

The geographic projections of the emerging areas in a few recent studies on single regions have been suggested to share two distinct properties: first, they are cohesive, and second, they tend to closely follow socio-economic boundaries and are similar to existing political regions in size and number. Here we use an extended set of countries and clustering indices to quantify overlaps, providing ample additional evidence for these observations using phone data from countries of various scales across Europe, Asia, and Africa: France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Ivory Coast. In our analysis we use the known approach of partitioning country-wide networks, and an additional iterative partitioning of each of the first level communities into subcommunities, revealing that cohesiveness and matching of official regions can also be observed on a second level if spatial resolution of the data is high enough. The method has possible policy implications on the definition of the borderlines and sizes of administrative regions.},

  abstract = {One of the principal rationales for accessibility planning in the UK is the potential reduction of social exclusion. Although there are multiple causes of social exclusion, transport and accessibility limitations contribute to a greater or lesser extent. It is in the light of this understanding the transport authorities are asked to devise policies which will promote inclusion. However, although the literature on social exclusion/inclusion is now quite substantial, and there are a number of Government documents available explaining the connections and their consequences, transport authorities are given little, if any, guidance by Central Government about the levels of accessibility to which they should and could reasonably be expected to aspire. This paper is based around research initially undertaken as part of an EPSRC-funded project {\textendash} AUNT-SUE (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport for Sustainable Urban Environments) which aims ``to develop and test sustainable policies and practice that will deliver effective socially inclusive design and operation in transport and the associated public realm from macro down to micro level.'' As part of this project, accessibility benchmarks and standards appropriate to various socially-excluded groups have been, and are being, developed and tested using both existing data and field research. The paper discusses the progress of this work and the difficulties of arriving at solutions which can both adequately reflect the needs of the affected groups, as groups rather than individuals, and which can also be successfully modelled.},

From the 27 studies that met our inclusion criteria, reported strengths and limitations were synthesized to determine key developments and common issues, illustrated with data from three app-based studies. We found consensus that app-based and crowdsourcing measures of fear of crime capture more precise spatial and temporal data alongside auxiliary information about the individual and the environment. Practical benefits, such as reduced cost of data collection and implementable outputs that are useful to practitioners were also highlighted. However, limitations around sampling biases, generalizability of findings, and the under-representation of certain areas persist.},

  abstract = {Urban flooding can cause widespread devastation in terms of loss of life and damage to property. As such, monitoring urban flood evolution is crucial in identifying the most affected areas, where emergency response resources should be directed. Flood monitoring through airborne or satellite remote sensing is often limited due to weather conditions and urban topography. In contrast, crowdsourced data is not affected by weather or topog\- raphy, and they hence offer great potential for urban flood monitoring through real-time information shared by individuals. Despite the benefits, there is no guarantee of quality associated with crowdsourced data, which hampers its usability. In this paper, we present and evaluate two different approaches (binary logistic regression and fuzzy logic) to assess the quality of crowdsourced social media data retrieved from the public Twitter archive. Input variables were constructed based on Twitter metadata and spatiotemporal analysis. Both models were trained and tested using actual flood-related information Tweeted during three consecutive years of flooding in Phetchaburi City, Thailand (2016 to 2018), and produced good results. The fuzzy logic approach is shown to perform better, however its implementation involves significantly more subjectivity. The ability to assess data quality enables the uncertainty associated with crowdsourced social media data to be estimated, which allows this type of data to supplement conventional observations, and hence improve flood management activities.},

Instead, it outlines the far-from-borderless landscape of MOOC participation in terms of geosocial unevenness using evidence from the discussion boards of a global MOOC on globalisation. Based on this empirical evidence, this article suggests that MOOCs can enable forms of connective action through online educational networking, but that these forms of cyborg knowledge formation are possible precisely because they are not `borderless, gender-blind, race-blind, class-blind and bank account blind'.},

We apply a semantic topic model classification and spatial autocorrelation analysis to detect tweets indicating specific human social activities. We correlated observed tweet patterns with official census data for the case study of London in order to underline the significance and reliability of Twitter data.

Using a comprehensive analysis of network density and network transitivity we found that the density of networks and the spatial clustering depends on the size of the network; smaller networks are more socially clustered and extend a smaller physical distance and larger networks are physically more dispersed with less social clustering. Additionally, Twitter networks are more effective at transmitting information at the local level. For example, local triadic connections are more than twice as likely to be transitive than those extending more than 500 km. This implies that not only is distance important to the communities developed in online social networks, but scale is extremely pertinent to the nature of these networks. Even as technologies such as Twitter enable a larger volume of interaction between spaces, these interactions do not invent completely new social and spatial patterns, but instead replicate existing arrangements.},

This paper presents an ontology of geometric configurations, to reflect and specify the range of spatial relations that have been discussed by previous researchers and that are commonly expressed in natural language, and to provide a sufficiently specific definition of the relations to allow them to be executed as spatial queries. Although this work was motivated by a goal to translate natural language describing location into spatial queries, we anticipate wider applications of the ontology for other purposes.},

However, the role of context has been widely acknowledged in natural language processing research and in linguistic studies of spatial language. There are a large number of different aspects of context that may be important in automated interpretation of location descriptions. In this paper, we present a summary of the contextual factors that have been discussed in the literature, and also describe and test a methodology for identifying contextual factors that respondents consider important in the use of specific spatial relations. We combine these sources to present a broad typology of contextual factors in the interpretation of geospatial natural language to set the scene for future research.},

  abstract = {Natural language descriptions of location can be complex, involving many different elements and often describing location by reference to other objects. Descriptions may be vague, and their meaning often depends upon the context within which the description has been expressed. Many previous approaches use mathematical models, focus on prepositions, and have had limited success and application. We present an approach to the interpretation of geospatial natural language expressions that uses a knowledge base of expressions for which human interpretations (in the form of degree of match to one of 50 geometric configurations) are known. Our approach interprets new expressions by finding the most similar knowledge base expression and adopting its meaning. We determine expression similarity using four different methods: element match; linguistic collocation approaches (Cosine); wordnet semantic network distance and a new approach that incorporates the contextual aspects of the expression including scale, geometry type, axial structure, image-schema and liquid/solid. As well as preposition, relatum and locatum, we consider spatial adjectives, adverbs, verb and sub-parts of the relatum and locatum. The method that incorporates context was the most successful of the four tested, selecting the same geometric configuration as human respondents in 69\% of cases.},

  abstract = {References to geographic locations are common in text data sources including social media and web pages. They take different forms from simple place names to relative expressions that describe location through a spatial relationship to a reference object (e.g. the house beside the Waikato River). Often complex, multi-word phrases are employed (e.g. the road and railway cross at right angles; the road in line with the canal) where spatial relationships are commu\- nicated with various parts of speech including prepositions, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. We address the problem of automatically detecting relative geospatial location descriptions, which we define as those that include spatial relation terms referencing geographic objects, and distinguishing them from non-geographical descrip\- tions of location (e.g. the book on the table). We experiment with several methods for automated classification of text expressions, using features for machine learning that include bag of words that detect distinctive words, word embeddings that encode meanings of words and manually identified language patterns that character\- ise geospatial expressions. Using three data sets created for this study, we find that ensemble and meta-classifier approaches, that variously combine predictions from several other classifiers with data features, provide the best F-measure of 0.90 for detecting geospatial expressions.},

However, there are many important factors affecting the success of an NLP approach to GIR, including toponym detection errors, toponym resolution errors, and query overloading. The aim of this paper is to determine how severe these errors are in state-of-the-art systems, and to what extent they affect GIR performance. We show that a careful choice of weighting schemes in the IR engine can minimize the negative impact of these errors on GIR accuracy.

  abstract = {Effective integration and wide sharing of geospatial data is an important and basic premise to facilitate the research and applications of geographic information science. However, the semantic heterogeneity of geospatial data is a major problem that significantly hinders geospatial data integration and sharing. Ontologies are regarded as a promising way to solve semantic problems by providing a formalized representation of geographic entities and relationships between them in a manner understandable to machines. Thus, many efforts have been made to explore ontology-based geospatial data integration and sharing. However, there is a lack of a specialized ontology that would provide a unified description for geospatial data. In this paper, with a focus on the characteristics of geospatial data, we propose a unified framework for geospatial data ontology, denoted GeoDataOnt, to establish a semantic foundation for geospatial data integration and sharing. First, we provide a characteristics hierarchy of geospatial data. Next, we analyze the semantic problems for each characteristic of geospatial data. Subsequently, we propose the general framework of GeoDataOnt, targeting these problems according to the characteristics of geospatial data. GeoDataOnt is then divided into multiple modules, and we show a detailed design and implementation for each module. Key limitations and challenges of GeoDataOnt are identified, and broad applications of GeoDataOnt are discussed.},

  abstract = {Historical maps contain rich geographic information about the past of a region. They are sometimes the only source of information before the availability of digital maps. Despite their valuable content, it is often challenging to access and use the information in historical maps, due to their forms of paper-based maps or scanned images. It is even more time-consuming and labor-intensive to conduct an analysis that requires a synthesis of the information from multiple historical maps. To facilitate the use of the geographic information contained in histor\- ical maps, one way is to build a geographic knowledge graph (GKG) from them. This paper proposes a general workflow for completing one important step of building such a GKG, namely aligning the same geographic entities from different maps. We present this workflow and the related methods for implementation, and systematically evaluate their performances using two different datasets of historical maps. The evaluation results show that machine learning and deep learning models for matching place names are sensitive to the thresholds learned from the training data, and a combination of measures based on string similarity, spatial distance, and approximate topologi\- cal relation achieves the best performance with an average F-score of 0.89.},

  abstract = {Objective The metadata reflecting the location of the infected host (LOIH) of virus sequences in GenBank often lacks specificity. This work seeks to enhance this metadata by extracting more specific geographic information from related full-text articles and mapping them to their latitude/ longitudes using knowledge derived from external geographical databases. Materials and Methods We developed a rule-based information extraction framework for linking GenBank records to the latitude/longitudes of the LOIH. Our system first extracts existing geospatial metadata from GenBank records and attempts to improve it by seeking additional, relevant geographic information from text and tables in related full-text PubMed Central articles. The final extracted locations of the records, based on data assimilated from these sources, are then disambiguated and mapped to their respective geo-coordinates. We evaluated our approach on a manually annotated dataset comprising of 5728 GenBank records for the influenza A virus. Results We found the precision, recall, and f-measure of our system for linking GenBank records to the latitude/longitudes of their LOIH to be 0.832, 0.967, and 0.894, respectively. Discussion Our system had a high level of accuracy for linking GenBank records to the geo-coordinates of the LOIH. However, it can be further improved by expanding our database of geospatial data, incorporating spell correction, and enhancing the rules used for extraction. Conclusion Our system performs reasonably well for linking GenBank records for the influenza A virus to the geo-coordinates of their LOIH based on record metadata and information extracted from related full-text articles. ....................................................................................................................................................},

Based on a large sample of publicly available Twitter data, our study shows that a substantial share of ties lies within the same metropolitan region, and that  between  regional clusters, distance, national borders and language differences all predict Twitter ties. We find that the frequency of airline flights between the two parties is the best predictor of Twitter ties. This highlights the importance of looking at pre-existing ties between places and people.},

  abstract = {The rise of social networking platforms provides opportunities to examine the relationship between public emotion and housing price. This study investigates frequency and places of visits, population sentiment, and housing price using 8.7 million tweets retrieved from Manhattan, New York City in 2019. We implemented kernel density estimation, Getis-Ord Gi hot spot analysis, and spatial lagged hedonic pricing models to identify the location variation of sentiment levels. The results show: (1) the spatial clustering of tweets frequency was highly related to land use types in places such as parks, financial districts, and train stations; (2) high sentiment levels coincided with high frequency clusters and higher positive sentiment is associated with higher housing price; and (3) sentiment level was significantly associated with housing price and building structure, amenities, and proximity to landmarks all had significant influences on housing price. The study indicates that a population with higher concentration of happiness correlates to higher property value and provides an innovative perspective to understand public sentiment in relation to housing price using social media data, supplemented by housing transaction data. We demonstrate a feasible framework for researchers and stakeholders to utilize in future urban and spatial geographical research.},

This paper examines the growing `buy-now-pay-later' (BNPL) phenomenon as a novel, platform-driven financial innovation to understand how this digitally mediated economic arrangement has produced new financial subjects and subjectivities. Using the idea of `platform ecologies' that combines the relational focus of financial ecologies with the logics of platform finance, this study highlights how the intermediary role of BNPL services has reshaped relational monetary practices through algorithmically driven modes of operating. Analysing Singapore's nascent BNPL landscape through content analysis of BNPL firm websites and critical media coverage of BNPL, this paper shows how automated technologies of risk assessment and debt collection are deployed to govern borrowers and keep them digitally attached to their debts, where creditworthiness is continuously evaluated in response to user transaction and repayment data. The strategic use of affect in framing BNPL services to satisfy immediate materialist consumption masks the fundamental nature of BNPL as debt, while the targeting of young individuals with no credit history through opaque techniques of credit and risk management creates new indebted subjects. The implications of such data-driven practices in producing greater indebtedness and further shaping financial subjectivities are discussed.},

To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting ``at scale'' that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.},

  abstract = {Voting results in marginal constituencies often determine wider political outcomes. It is now apparent that key electorates in these areas have been geo-behaviourally targeted by elaborate operations intended to manipulate results through advertising, (mis)information, and/or `fake news' disseminated via online social networks. Attempts to track the geographical diffusion of cyber politicking are hindered by incomplete geospatial referencing in social media (meta)data. Just about 1{\textendash}2\% of publicly posted Twitter tweets, and even fewer Facebook posts, are typically `geotagged' with Latitude and Longitude coordinates. Many more records (about 25\%) make toponymic mention of place. This paper examines about 8 million social media interactions, over 350,000 of which are geotagged, created during the 2012 US Presidential Election and the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum campaigns, to assess the interplay of space and place in online communications. Results of text and data-mining show that coordinate-geotagging users of Twitter and Facebook, (a) make fewer references to place in their message text, (b) link to articles making fewer mentions of place in their content, and (c) make far fewer links to external content than their non-coordinate-geotagging peers. Despite providing some valuable geospatial information, coordinate-geotagged interactions offer only an inadequate proxy for tracking the spread of all places, linked content, or (mis)information shared online. As Twitter retires its tweet spatialization functionality, new regulatory and technical responses together with a better understanding of place will be required if electoral officials, platform operators, and researchers are to more easily and accurately identify nefarious content targeting specific areas as well as specific individuals during democratic elections.},

The information may consist of users' emotions, feedbacks, reviews, and personal experiences. In this research a novel Ontology-based Sentiment Analysis Process for Social Media content (OSAPS) with negative sentiments is presented. The social media content is automatically extracted from the twitter messages. An ontology-based process is designed to retrieve and analyse the customers' tweet with negative sentiments. This idea is demonstrated with the identification of customer dissatisfaction of the delivery service issues of the United States Postal Service, Royal Mail of United Kingdom, and Canada post. The tweets related to the delivery service include delay in delivery, lost package/s or improper customer services at the office in person or at call centres. A combination of technologies for twitter extraction, data cleaning, subjective analysis, ontology model building, and sentiment analysis are used. The results from this analysis could be used by the company to take corrective measures for the problems as well as to generate an automated online reply for the issues. A rulebased classifier could be used for generating the automated online replies.},

Using geocoded microdata, this article reveals how employment-led migration represents only a minority share ({$\approx$}30\%) of total migration events over 40 km. Family motives appear just as important, even at distances {$\geq$}100 km, with the desire to live closer to non-resident family/friends being the most frequently cited family submotive. Estimated propensities to undertake employment and educational-related migration fit very closely to predictions of human capital models of migration, being highest among young, residentially flexible and highly educated individuals. Migrants citing family-related motives are disproportionately drawn from midlife and later-life phases, with family shown to be a key motive among migrants with care-related needs (e.g., parents with children) or access to fewer resources (e.g., social renters and low educational attainment).},

Data Sources: Eight electronic databases were searched from 1980 to 2004 (IBSS, COPAC, HMIC, IDOX, INSIDE, Medline, Urbadisc/Accompline, Web of Knowledge). Bibliographies of located documents and relevant web sites were searched. Experts and government departmental libraries were also contacted. Review methods: Evaluations that reported achievements drawing on data from at least two target areas of a national urban regeneration programme in the UK were included. Process evaluations and evaluations reporting only business outcomes were excluded. All methods of evaluation were included. Impact data on direct health outcomes and direct measures of socioeconomic determinants of health were narratively synthesised. Results: 19 evaluations reported impacts on health or socioeconomic determinants of health; data from 10 evaluations were synthesised. Three evaluations reported health impacts; in one evaluation three of four measures of self reported health deteriorated, typically by around 4\%. Two other evaluations reported overall reductions in mortality rates. Most socioeconomic outcomes assessed showed an overall improvement after regeneration investment; however, the effect size was often similar to national trends. In addition, some evaluations reported adverse impacts. Conclusion: There is little evidence of the impact of national urban regeneration investment on socioeconomic or health outcomes. Where impacts have been assessed, these are often small and positive but adverse impacts have also occurred. Impact data from future evaluations are required to inform healthy public policy; in the meantime work to exploit and synthesise ``best available'' data is required.},

  abstract = {Many urban policies aim to improve areas and address socioeconomic deprivation. The resulting investment is often delivered through area-based programmes which incorporate initiatives to improve the physical, social and economic environment. Hypotheses that these investments can contribute to wider public health strategies are based on epidemiological data and used to support the concept of healthy urban policy. However, there is little evidence on their ability to generate positive impacts on socioeconomic or health outcomes. The lack of validating evidence on actual impacts raises two important questions: (1) Is areabased investment an effective strategy to tackle socioeconomic deprivation? (2) What is the prospect for new and improved evaluations to provide stronger evidence? Both the programmes of area investment and their accompanying evaluations have been criticised for being overly ambitious in what can be achieved by the investment and what can be measured by an evaluation. Area-based approaches to tackling deprivation have their advantages but a mix of area and individual-level targeting is likely to be needed. While there is scope to improve the utility of evaluation data there are also inevitable constraints on assessing and attributing impacts from urban investment. The inherent limitations to an area-based approach and the ongoing constraints on impact evaluation will inevitably temper expectations of what healthy urban policy can achieve. However, lack of evidence is not grounds to abandon the concept of healthy urban policy; adoption of more realistic expectations together with improved evaluation data may help to increase its credibility.},

Social exclusion occurs as a result of a series of problems that prevent people from being able to participate in activities that are considered normal in their society.  Some of these problems are related to issues of accessibility. This paper outlines work carried out in the context of the AUNT-SUE (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport in Sustainable Urban Environments) project to develop and model an appropriate set of accessibility benchmarks for older people.  Results confirmed that the travel patterns of older people are very different from those of the average person in the UK and that it was necessary to tailor accessibility benchmarks to the characteristics of this group.  A set of benchmarks was developed based on ability to undertake different types of activity.  These benchmarks are currently being incorporated into AMELIA, a GIS-based tool for assessing the effect of different policy actions on accessibility.  Issues that have arisen include how to model the myriad micro-level circumstances that affect the mobility of older people.  Some initial analysis has shown that these details can make a substantial difference to the assessment of the accessibility of a destination.  Examples are drawn from St Albans in Hertfordshire, UK.},

Although there is some anecdotal evidence on the `end of geography' effect of the Internet, the relationship between physical space and the Internet has not been yet scrutinized. In addition, owing to the network nature of the Internet, the structure of the Internet infrastructure (the cyber-place) cannot be approached in a unidimensional way. Our paper builds upon recent studies in economic geography and relational proximities, and aims to study whether physical distance survives in virtual geography even after controlling for relational proximities. In order to do so, a unique and extensive database with geo-coded IP links is utilized. Based on this, a spatial interaction model with panel data specifications is constructed to study the impact of different types of proximity on the formation of cyber-place. The above analysis is framed by a complex network analysis exercise, which enhances our understanding of the complexity of the Internet infrastructure from a spatial network perspective. Our results indicate that physical distance, but also different relational proximities, have a significant impact on the intensity of the Internet infrastructure, highlighting the spatiality of the Internet.},

  abstract = {In recent years urban policy has come to rely increasingly on private-sector property development to provide the driving force. Popular opinion is sharply divided about the value of this approach. In this paper, an examination is made of five ways in which property could contribute to urban economic regeneration: through the direct employment effects of construction-related activity; by accommodating the expansion of indigenous firms; by attracting inward investment; by revitalising run-down neighbourhoods; and by initiating areawide economic restructuring. Appropriate property development can have positive economic effects but it has to be part of a more holistic approach that embodies concerns for people living in deprived areas and for the underlying condition of the local economy. Unrestrained market-led development may have detrimental consequences for the economic fabric of cities and for the quality of life of their residents.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Social networks play an important role in disaster situations as they have become a new form of social convergence that provides collective information. The effect of social media on people who experienced disaster should be assessed. Hypothesis: In this study, Twitter communication during the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011 was assessed. The hypothesis of this study was that usage of Twitter had psychological effects on victims of the disaster. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was carried out in cooperation with a major Japanese newspaper three months after the disaster, and 1,144 volunteer participants responded. They were asked about their health, area of residence, property damage they had experienced, information sources they used at the time of the disaster, and their usage of Twitter. Further, the Twitter users were divided into two groups{\textemdash}with and without disaster experience. Their psychological effects relating to feelings of relief, stress or anxiety that they experienced in using Twitter were compared between two groups, and Twitter's psychological risk of disaster experience was estimated as an odds ratio. Results: Twitter users in this study tended to reside in disaster-affected areas and thought Twitter was a credible information source during the time of the disaster. The psychological effect of Twitter differed based on participants' disaster experience and gender. Females with disaster experience reported more feelings of relief and stress as a result of using Twitter compared to females who did not experience the disaster. On the other hand, males with disaster experience only reported more stress experiences as a result of using Twitter compared to those without disaster experience. Conclusion: Twitter users with disaster experience had a higher usage of Twitter than those without disaster experience. Social media might have had a material psychological influence on people who experienced disaster, and the effect differed by gender. Regardless of gender, negative feelings were transmitted easily among people who experienced the disaster. It was anticipated that the application of Twitter in a disaster situation will be expanded further by taking these findings into consideration.},

This paper proposes an approach for the early detection of emerging hotspot events in social networks with location sensitivity. We consider the message-mentioned locations for identifying the locations of events. In our approach, we identify strong correlations between user locations and event locations in detecting the emerging events. We evaluate our approach based on a real-world Twitter dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively detect emerging events with respect to user locations that have different granularities.},

After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purpose they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the specification, implementation and evalution of ontologies. Finally, we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field, considering various case studies, software tools for ontology development, key research issues and future prospects.},

We focus on the positional uncertainties and extent vagueness frequently associated with place names in linguistic place descriptions and on the differences between common users' perception and the way that geographic information services interpret place names. We argue that despite some notable efforts from the scientific community, geographic information services still cannot unambiguously recognize and sufficiently reason spatially with place names from linguistic expressions. We focus on three interrelated research areas: (a) the use of place names in gazetteers, (b) the use of formal models to reason with spatial relations and with the spatial extent of place names in linguistic place descriptions, and (c) Web harvesting and crowd sourcing techniques for identifying place names and their spatial extension from public and volunteer sources such as social networks and photo-sharing sites. We identify some opportunities for synthesizing existing approaches that would expedite the process of intelligent communication about place names between services and users. We discuss the shortcomings of the current state of affairs in locating place names from place descriptions, and identify new areas of importance for future research.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The LIDAR data collected from a nadir direction is a point cloud containing surface samples of not only the building roofs and terrain but also undesirable clutter from trees, cars, etc. The main contribution of this work is the automatic recognition and estimation of simple parametric shapes that can be combined to model very complex buildings from aerial LIDAR data. The main components of the detection and modeling algorithms are (i) Segmentation of roof and terrain points. (ii) Roof topology Inference. We introduce the concept of a roof-topology graph to represent the relationships between the various planar patches of a complex roof structure. (iii) Parametric roof composition. Simple parametric roof shapes that can be combined to create a complex roof structure of a building are recognized by searching for sub-graphs in its roof-topology graph. (iv) Terrain Modeling. The terrain is identified and modeled as a triangulated mesh. Finally, we provide experimental results that demonstrate the validity of our approach for rapid and automatic building detection and geometric modeling with real LIDAR data. We are able to model cities and other urban areas at the rate of about 10 minutes per sq. mile on a low-end PC.},

  abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract = {Laser altimetry is becoming the prime method for large scale acquisition of height data. Although laser altimetry is full integrated into processes for the production of digital elevation models in different countries, the derivation of DEM's from the raw laser altimetry measurements still causes problems. In particular the laser pulses reflected on the ground surface need to be distinguished from those reflecting on buildings and vegetation. In this paper a new method is proposed for filtering laser data. This method is closely related to the erosion operator used for mathematical grey scale morphology. Based on height differences in a representative training dataset, filter functions are derived that either preserve important terrain characteristics or minimise the number of classification errors. In experiments it is shown that the latter filter causes smaller errors in the resulting digital elevation models. In general the performance of the filters deteriorates with a decreasing point density.},

For the (semi-)automated extraction of geo-information from point clouds these high point densities are very beneficial. The large number of points on the surfaces of objects to be extracted describe the surface geometry with a high redundancy. This allows the reliable detection of such surfaces in a point cloud. In this paper various examples are presented on how point cloud segmentations can be used to automatically extract geo-information. The paper focusses on the extraction of man-made objects in the urban environment. The examples include the processing of point clouds acquired by airborne, mobile as well as terrestrial laser scanners. The usage of generic knowledge on the objects to be mapped is shown to play a key role in the automation of the point cloud interpretation.},

One reason for this is the emergence of user-generated geographic information, which partially represents subjective everyday geographical encounters. No consensus, however, on how to deal with place in GIScience has yet been reached. This paper presents a systematic literature review providing an overview of how parts of the GIScience community currently use the concept of place as it is understood in human geography. The results suggest that most place related GIScience scholars refer to the humanistic tradition of geography focusing on the essence of experiences of place. Further, it is found that geotagged data published online are a major driver of place-based research, whereas scientific data (e.g., surveys) are less commonly found in respective papers. Many researchers make use of exploratory approaches, which may reflect the early stage at which place-based GIScience research still sits. We also identify a difference between the approach core members of GIScience take and those working on the edge of the field. Thereby, the former often work more conceptually than the latter. The results of this preliminary review inform the current GIScience discourse on place by important evidence about the intellectual standpoints of GIScience scholars, thus fostering future research into place.},

Infrastructure designated for visitor use (i.e., roads, trails) contributed most to models of visitor distribution for all years and seasons. During the spring months, elevation was also a top contributing variable to the model. Crowdsourced data provided empirical assessments of covariates associated with visitor distributions, highlighting how changes in infrastructure and environmental factors may influence visitor use, and therefore resource pressures, to help researchers, managers, and planners with efforts to mitigate negative impacts.},

We describe an approach to building a corpus of natural language expressions extracted from web documents for analyzing and modeling spatial relational expressions (SRE). The unique characteristic of this corpus is that it is built around georeferenced triplets, with each triplet containing two entities (including their latitude/longitude coordinates) related by a spatial expression such as near. While the approach is still experimental, our first results are promising, in that we believe they will form the foundation for a comprehensive contextualized model for interpreting spatial natural language expressions. For the time being, we are focusing on a single domain, hotel reviews. This domain restriction allowed us to implement a proof-of-concept that this approach, with advances in natural language technologies, will indeed deliver a comprehensive corpus. The potential to collect larger corpora, and associated challenges, is discussed.},

  abstract = {The objective of segmentation on point clouds is to spatially group points with similar properties into homogeneous regions. Segmentation is a fundamental issue in processing point clouds data acquired by LiDAR and the quality of segmentation largely determines the success of information retrieval. Unlike the image or TIN model, the point clouds do not explicitly represent topology information. As a result, most existing segmentation methods for image and TIN have encountered two difficulties. First, converting data from irregular 3-D point clouds to other models usually leads to information loss; this is particularly a serious drawback for range image based algorithms. Second, the high computation cost of converting a large volume of point data is a considerable problem for any large scale LiDAR application. In this paper, we investigate the strategy to develop LiDAR segmentation methods directly based on point clouds data model. We first discuss several potential local similarity measures based on discrete computation geometry and machine learning. A prototype algorithm supported by fast nearest neighborhood search and based on advanced similarity measures is proposed and implemented to segment point clouds directly. Our experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and robust comparing with algorithms based on image and TIN. The paper will review popular segmentation methods in related disciplines and present the segmentation results of diverse buildings with different levels of difficulty.},

Around 25K users, 500K tweets, and 49M follower/friend relationships in total are collected from public available data on Twitter. Bayesian classification algorithm is applied to distinguish the suspicious behaviors from normal ones. I analyze the data set and evaluate the performance of the detection system. Classic evaluation metrics are used to compare the performance of various traditional classification methods. Experiment results show that the Bayesian classifier has the best overall performance in term of F-measure. The trained classifier is also applied to the entire data set.

However, when the pair of entities has multiple relationships in the KG, this assumption may produce noisy relation labels. This paper proposes a label-free distant supervision method, which makes no use of the relation labels under this inadequate assumption, but only uses the prior knowledge derived from the KG to supervise the learning of the classifier directly and softly. Specifically, we make use of the type information and the translation law derived from typical KG embedding model to learn embeddings for certain sentence patterns. As the supervision signal is only determined by the two aligned entities, neither hard relation labels nor extra noise-reduction model for the bag of sentences is needed in this way. The experiments show that the approach performs well in current distant supervision dataset.},

Current knowledge representations regard information as items linked to relevant objects or concepts by tree or graph structures. However, geographic knowledge differs from general knowledge, which is more focused on temporal, spatial, and changing knowledge. Thus, discrete knowledge items are difficult to represent geographic states, evolutions, and mechanisms, e.g., the processes of a storm \&ldquo;\{9:30-60 mm-precipitation\}-\{12:00-80 mm-precipitation\}-\&hellip;\&rdquo;. The underlying problem is the constructors of the logic foundation (ALC description language) of current geographic knowledge representations, which cannot provide these descriptions. To address this issue, this study designed a formalized geographic knowledge representation called GeoKG and supplemented the constructors of the ALC description language. Then, an evolution case of administrative divisions of Nanjing was represented with the GeoKG. In order to evaluate the capabilities of our formalized model, two knowledge graphs were constructed by using the GeoKG and the YAGO by using the administrative division case. Then, a set of geographic questions were defined and translated into queries. The query results have shown that GeoKG results are more accurate and complete than the YAGO\&rsquo;s with the enhancing state information. Additionally, the user evaluation verified these improvements, which indicates it is a promising powerful model for geographic knowledge representation.},

A geoparsing system, known as a geoparser, takes some texts as the input and outputs the recognized place mentions and their location coordinates. In June 2019, a geoparsing competition, Toponym Resolution in Scientific Papers, was held as one of the SemEval 2019 tasks. The winning teams developed neural network based geoparsers that achieved outstanding performances (over 90\% precision, recall, and F1 score for toponym recognition). This exciting result brings the question ``are we there yet?'', namely have we achieved high enough performances to possibly consider the problem of geoparsing as solved? One limitation of this competition is that the developed geoparsers were tested on only one dataset which has 45 research articles collected from the particular domain of Bio-medicine. It is known that the same geoparser can have very different performances on different datasets. Thus, this work performs a systematic evaluation of these state-of-the-art geoparsers using our recently developed benchmarking platform EUPEG that has eight annotated datasets, nine baseline geoparsers, and eight performance metrics. The evaluation result suggests that these new geoparsers indeed improve the performances of geoparsing on multiple datasets although some challenges remain.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how to construct knowledge graphs (KGs) from pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3), without human supervision. Popular KGs (e.g, Wikidata, NELL) are built in either a supervised or semi-supervised manner, requiring humans to create knowledge. Recent deep language models automatically acquire knowledge from large-scale corpora via pre-training. The stored knowledge has enabled the language models to improve downstream NLP tasks, e.g., answering questions, and writing code and articles. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to cast the knowledge contained within language models into KGs. We show that KGs are constructed with a single forward pass of the pre-trained language models (without fine-tuning) over the corpora. We demonstrate the quality of the constructed KGs by comparing to two KGs (Wikidata, TAC KBP) created by humans. Our KGs also provide open factual knowledge that is new in the existing KGs. Our code and KGs will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Social media messages, such as tweets, are frequently used by people during natural disasters to share real-time information and to report incidents. Within these messages, geographic locations are often described. Accurate recognition and geolocation of these locations are critical for reaching those in need. This article focuses on the first part of this process, namely recognizing locations from social media messages. While general named entity recognition tools are often used to recognize locations, their performance is limited due to the various language irregularities associated with social media text, such as informal sentence structures, inconsistent letter cases, name abbreviations, and misspellings. We present NeuroTPR, which is a Neuro-net ToPonym Recognition model designed specifically with these linguistic irregularities in mind. Our approach extends a general bidirectional recurrent neural network model with a number of features designed to address the task of location recognition in social media messages. We also propose an automatic workflow for generating annotated data sets from Wikipedia articles for training toponym recognition models. We demonstrate NeuroTPR by applying it to three test data sets, including a Twitter data set from Hurricane Harvey, and comparing its performance with those of six baseline models.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in Named Entity Recognition (NER) show that document-level contexts can significantly improve model performance. In many application scenarios, however, such contexts are not available. In this paper, we propose to find external contexts of a sentence by retrieving and selecting a set of semantically relevant texts through a search engine, with the original sentence as the query. We find empirically that the contextual representations computed on the retrieval-based input view, constructed through the concatenation of a sentence and its external contexts, can achieve significantly improved performance compared to the original input view based only on the sentence. Furthermore, we can improve the model performance of both input views by Cooperative Learning, a training method that encourages the two input views to produce similar contextual representations or output label distributions. Experiments show that our approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on 8 NER data sets across 5 domains.},

Among these aspects, culture, as an important content of human society, is also a manifestation of inter-city association. The recognition of inter-city cultural association patterns plays an important role in understanding the spatial distribution pattern of culture. This article defines cultural eigenvectors to represent city cultural characteristics by mining the semantics of place names. On this basis, a cultural semantic similarity network (CSSN) is constructed to recognize inter-city cultural association patterns. Meanwhile, the related algorithm is designed to discover the cultural spatial structures using China as a case study. Finally, four types of cultural hubs, four typical cultural belts, and 13 cultural circles are identified. This article not only recognizes the cultural importance and associations of Chinese cities, but also provides a reference for other city association studies.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of people don't use a scientific geographical vocabulary, nevertheless most use a wide variety of geographical terms on a day to day basis. Identifiers like ``Downtown'' or ``The grim area around the docks'' are part of a vernacular geographical terminology which is vastly more used than the coordinate systems and scientifically defined variables so beloved of professional geographers. These terms not only identify areas, but give members of our sociolinguistic group information about them, building up a jointly-defined cultural world-view within which we all act on a daily basis. Despite its importance for policy making and quality of life, attention is rarely paid to this vernacular geography because it is so hard to capture and use. This paper presents a new set of tools for capturing these ``fuzzy'' psychogeographical areas and their associated attributes, through a web based mapping system. The system contains a spraycan tool that allows users to tag information onto diffuse areas of varying density. An example of their use to define areas people consider are ``high crime'' within a UK city is also presented, along with users' responses to the system. Such a system aims to pull together professional and popular geographical understanding, to the advantage of both.},

Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models.

We take a 137B parameter pretrained language model and instruction-tune it on over 60 NLP tasks verbalized via natural language instruction templates. We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodified counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 20 of 25 tasks that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze. Ablation studies reveal that number of finetuning datasets, model scale, and natural language instructions are key to the success of instruction tuning.},

By studying virus migration and mutation patterns, the field of phylogeography provides a valuable tool for improving their surveillance. A key component in phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses involves identifying the specific locations of relevant viral sequences. This is usually accomplished by querying public databases such as GenBank and examining the geospatial metadata in the record. When sufficient detail is not available, a logical next step is for the researcher to conduct a manual survey of the corresponding published articles.},

Given an article from PubMed, the task consists of detecting mentions of names of places, or toponyms, and mapping the mentions to their corresponding entries in GeoNames.org, a database of geospatial locations. We proposed three subtasks. In Subtask 1, we asked participants to detect all toponyms in an article. In Subtask 2, given toponym mentions as input, we asked participants to disambiguate them by linking them to entries in GeoNames. In Subtask 3, we asked participants to perform both the detection and the disambiguation steps for all toponyms. A total of 29 teams registered, and 8 teams submitted a system run. We summarize the corpus and the tools created for the challenge. They are freely available at https://competitions.codalab. org/competitions/19948. We also analyze the methods, the results and the errors made by the competing systems with a focus on toponym disambiguation.},

  abstract = {Using new comparative data bases this paper examines whether infant mortality rates in industrialised nations are affected by public policies and income inequality. Particular attention is given to the role of the level of economic development, public policy and the distribution of economic resources. The study shows that the level of economic development has a strong, but decreasing impact on the infant mortality rate. Income inequality and relative poverty rates appear to be of greater importance for the variation in infant mortality rates than the level of economic development between rich countries. Levels of unemployment and of social security benefits seems to affect the infant mortality rate; the combination of high unemployment and low unemployment benefits seems to be associated with particularly high mortality rates. A high level of family benefits is also associated with low infant mortality rates.},

In some fields like human geography, spatial cognition or information theory, this topic already has a longer scholarly tradition. This is however not yet completely the case with statistical spatial analysis and cartography. Despite that, taking full advantage of the plethora of user-generated information that we have available these days requires mature place-based statistical and visualization concepts. This paper contributes to these developments: We integrate existing place definitions into an understanding of places as a system of interlinked, constituent characteristics. Based on this, challenges and first promising conceptual ideas are discussed from statistical and visualization viewpoints.},

Briefly put, while locations provide objective references (e.g., point coordinates), places are the units utilized by humans to approach the geographic world. The PLATIAL'18 workshop makes a significant contribution towards establishing a notion of place and is meant to be the starting point for a series of future events. What sets this workshop apart from others dealing with the concept of place is that the focus is decisively on its quantitative investigation and conceptual formalization. The workshop accommodates a wide range of aspects all of which in one or another way are related to the two outlined core foci. This is well reflected by the various topical sessions into which the workshop has been organized. These include ``Conceptual Anatomy of Place'', ``Disclosing Places from Human Discourse'', ``Bridging Space and Place'', and ``Exploratory and Visual Analytics of Place''. The content sessions were concomitantly inspired by two keynote talks by Alexis Comber (University of Leeds) and Clare Davies (University of Winchester).},

The concept of place is a topic of increasing interest among GIScience scholars. First attempts to formalise platial information have been made and it is increasingly held that user-generated data sets in particular are often more platial than spatial in nature. At the same time, and especially when compared to geometric spatial concepts, the concept of place is ambiguous, complex and difficult to capture in formal and analytical terms, suggesting the need for interdisciplinary approaches. This collection presents articles covering a wide range of place-related aspects, including both conceptual and more applied contributions. In the present editorial we summarise these and comment on their individual contributions, and hope that the readership of Transactions in GIS will find the special collection inspiring and informative.},

  abstract = {In this article, a new method called spatial amplifier filtering is proposed. The presented method is related to Moran eigenvector filtering and allows the accentuation of spatial structures in heterogeneous data sets. The spatial amplifier filtering technique is based on the inclusion of certain eigenvectors of a spatial weights matrix into a regression model. The application of this method can be seen as a pre-processing step prior to subsequent analyses, and to separate different types of spatially correlated components in a data set. For this purpose, three different types of the so-called spatial amplifiers are proposed, each consisting of different subsets of eigenvectors of the weights matrix. These amplifiers can either emphasise the positive or negative spatial autocorrelation, or spatial structuring in general. In this way, it is possible to make desired spatial structures more visible, especially in spatially highly mixed data sets, whereby the focus here is on geosocial media data. In the empirical part of the article, it is first shown why georeferenced social media data are difficult to handle from a spatial analysis perspective, motivating the need for the method proposed. Subsequently, the technique of amplifier filtering is applied to two data sets: a census data set from Brazil and Twitter data from London. The results obtained show that the method is capable of strengthening existing spatial structures and mitigating potentially disturbing spatial randomness patterns and other nuisances. This facilitates the interpretation especially of the Twitter data used. While the analysis of the unfiltered Twitter data with established methods reveals little information about possible spatial structures in the tweets, the filtered data offer a much clearer picture with distinguishable clusters. In addition, the method also provides insights into the internal irregularity of spatial clusters and thus complements the toolbox for investigating spatial heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Globally, motor vehicle crashes account for over 1.2 million fatalities per year and are the leading cause of death for people aged 15{\textendash}29 years. The majority of road crashes are caused by human error, with risk heightened among young and novice drivers learning to negotiate the complexities of the road environment. Direct feedback has been shown to have a positive impact on driving behaviour. Methods that could detect behavioural changes and therefore, positively reinforce safer driving during the early stages of driver licensing could have considerable road safety benefit. A new methodology is presented combining in-vehicle telematics technology, providing measurements forming a personalised driver profile, with neural networks to identify changes in driving behaviour. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, individual drivers are identified based on their pattern of acceleration, deceleration and exceeding the speed limit. After model calibration, new, real-time data of the driver is supplied to the LSTM and, by monitoring prediction performance, one can assess whether a (positive or negative) change in driving behaviour is occurring over time. The paper highlights that the approach is robust to different neural network structures, data selections, calibration settings, and methodologies to select benchmarks for safe and unsafe driving. Presented case studies show additional model applications for investigating changes in driving behaviour among individuals following or during specific events (e.g., receipt of insurance renewal letters) and time periods (e.g., driving during holiday periods). The application of the presented methodology shows potential to form the basis of timely provision of direct feedback to drivers by telematics-based insurers. Such feedback may prevent internalisation of new, risky driving habits contributing to crash risk, potentially reducing deaths and injuries among young drivers as a result.},

The number of quantitative assessment studies of the impact of climate change on urban drainage remains, however, rather limited. This is partly because of the particular difficulties when dealing with this type of impact. First problem is that the results of climate models need be downscaled to very small space and time resolutions (e.g. catchments of few kilometers, time scales as low as 5 minutes). The impact results consequently are highly uncertain, a problem that becomes more challenging since the properties of extremes do not automatically reflect those of average precipitation.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Since its introduction in 2006, messages posted to the microblogging system Twitter have provided a rich dataset for researchers, leading to the publication of over a thousand academic papers. This paper aims to identify this published work and to classify it in order to understand Twitter based research. Design/methodology/approach: Firstly the papers on Twitter were identified. Secondly, following a review of the literature, a classification of the dimensions of microblogging research was established. Thirdly, papers were qualitatively classified using open coded content analysis, based on the paper's title and abstract, in order to analyze method, subject, and approach. Findings: The majority of published work relating to Twitter concentrates on aspects of the messages sent and details of the users. A variety of methodological approaches is used across a range of identified domains. Research limitations/implications: This work reviewed the abstracts of all papers available via database search on the term "Twitter" and this has two major implications: the full papers are not considered and so works may be misclassified if their abstract is not clear; publications not indexed by the databases, such as book chapters, are not included. The study is focussed on microblogging, the applicability of the approach to other media is not considered. Originality/value: To date there has not been an overarching study to look at the methods and purpose of those using Twitter as a research subject. The paper's major contribution is to scope out papers published on Twitter until the close of 2011. The classification derived here will provide a framework within which researchers studying Twitter related topics will be able to position and ground their work. {\copyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Resolving places to single georeferenced points has been identified as a major factor. The prevailing hypothesis is that more complex georeferenced descriptions of places will resolve the problem. This paper refutes this hypothesis. It challenges it from five perspectives including issues related to: determining positional accuracy, defining vague and dynamic places, administering natural places with uncertain boundaries, supporting vanity and vernacular places, and representing the salience of places. These five perspectives demonstrate that while more complex modeling of place is necessary, it is only part of the solution. Successful spatial enablement of place will require other essential issues to be addressed including: combining absolute, relative, and visual accuracy definitions of place, using emerging sources of data (e.g. crowd-sourced) to develop dynamic descriptions of places, determining how to capture `places' from remotely sensed data, incorporating vanity and vernacular places into spatial data infrastructures, and embedding measures of the salience of place into spatial data infrastructures. These findings are synthesized into a future research agenda in spatial data infrastructures, or spatial information science in general.},

The identification and extraction of toponyms and spatial information mentioned in historical text collections has allowed its use in innovative ways, making possible the application of spatial analysis and the mapping of these places with geographic information systems. For instance, automated place name identification is possible with Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. Statistical NER methods based on supervised learning, in particular, are highly successful with modern datasets. However, there are still major challenges to address when dealing with historical corpora. These challenges include language changes over time, spelling variations, transliterations, OCR errors, and sources written in multiple languages among others. In this article, considering a task of place name recognition over two collections of historical correspondence, we report an evaluation of five NER systems and an approach that combines these through a voting system. We found that although individual performance of each NER system was corpus dependent, the ensemble combination was able to achieve consistent measures of precision and recall, outperforming the individual NER systems. In addition, the results showed that these NER systems are not strongly dependent on preprocessing and translation to Modern English.},

Issues discussed in further detail are the truth gap{\textemdash}truth glut hypotheses regarding the psychology of vague predicates, and formal properties of the three-valued nearness relation. The conclusion is drawn that formal theories can usefully underpin and be applied to reasoning with vague spatial notions, such as nearness.},

Drawing from a major cross-disciplinary investigation of food access and food poverty in British cities, the authors report in this paper findings from the first `before/after' study of food consumption in a highly deprived area of a British city experiencing a sudden and significant change in its food-retail access. The study has been viewed as the first opportunity in the United Kingdom to assess the impact of a non-healthcare intervention (specifically a retail-provision intervention) on food-consumption patterns, and by extension diet-related health, in such a deprived, previously poor-retail-access community. The paper offers evidence of a positive but modest impact of the retail intervention on diet, and the authors discuss the ways in which their findings are potentially significant in the context of policy debate.},

However, little is known about the relationship between geometric design consistency and traffic safety. In this study, design consistency is referred to as the difference between operating speed and inferred design speed, and design consistency density is measured to account for the effect of elements upstream and downstream of the study element. To perform the design consistency{\textendash}safety evaluation in the present study, geometric design, roadway inventory, crash, and operating speed data were collected along two case-study highways in central Pennsylvania (U.S. 322 and PA 350). Several count regression model formulations were used to explore the statistical association between design consistency and total crash frequency. A statistically significant positive association between geometric design consistency and safety was found. Design consistency surrounding the study elements was also found to increase the expected crash frequency in the study element. The significant effects of design consistency and design consistency density measures on crash frequency for the two case-study sites indicate that there is value in further considering the relationship between design consistency and safety in future research, particularly in the context of the highway safety manual crash-prediction algorithm.

Owing to the advancements in the field of high-resolution remote sensing, and the success of semantic segmentation success using deep learning in computer version, extracting the road network from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly popular, and has become a new tool to update the geospatial database. Considering that the training dataset of the deep convolutional neural network will be clipped to a fixed size, which lead to the roads run through each sample, and that different kinds of road types have different widths, this work provides a segmentation model that was designed based on densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) and introduces the local and global attention units. The aim of this work is to propose a novel road extraction method that can efficiently extract the road network from remote sensing imagery with local and global information. A dataset from Google Earth was used to validate the method, and experiments showed that the proposed deep convolutional neural network can extract the road network accurately and effectively. This method also achieves a harmonic mean of precision and recall higher than other machine learning and deep learning methods.},

It is basic information for further analysis in several applications including road surface settlement, pavement condition assessment and slope collapse. Mobile LiDAR system (MLS) is frequently used now a days to collect detail road surface and its surrounding information in terms three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. Extraction of road surface from volumetric point cloud data is still in infancy stage because of heavy data processing requirement and the complexity in the road environment. The extraction of roads especially rural road, where road-curb is not present is very tedious job especially in Indian roadway settings. Only a few studies are available, and none for Indian roads, in the literature for rural road detection. The limitations of existing studies are in terms of their lower accuracy, very slow speed of data processing and detection of other objects having similar characteristics as the road surface. A fast and accurate method is proposed for LiDAR data points of road surface detection, keeping in mind the essence of road surface extraction especially for Indian rural roads. The Mobile LiDAR data in XYZI format is used as input in the proposed method. First square gridding is performed and ground points are roughly extracted. Then planar surface detection using mathematical framework of principal component analysis (PCA) is performed and further road surface points are detected using similarity in intensity and height difference of road surface pointe in their neighbourhood.},

One prerequisite to these tasks is the ability to capture the similarity and relatedness between POI types. Intuitively, a spatial search that returns body shops or even gas stations in the absence of auto repair places is still likely to satisfy some user needs while returning planetariums will not. Place hierarchies are frequently used for query expansion, but most of the existing hierarchies are relatively shallow and structured from a single perspective, thereby putting POI types that may be closely related regarding some characteristics far apart from another. This leads to the question of how to learn POI type representations from data. Models such as Word2Vec that produces word embeddings from linguistic contexts are a novel and promising approach as they come with an intuitive notion of similarity. However, the structure of geographic space, e.g., the interactions between POI types, differs substantially from linguistics. In this work, we present a novel method to augment the spatial contexts of POI types using a distance-binned, information-theoretic approach to generate embeddings. We demonstrate that our work outperforms Word2Vec and other models using three different evaluation tasks and strongly correlates with human assessments of POI type similarity. We published the resulting embeddings for 570 place types as well as a collection of human similarity assessments online for others to use.},

In recent years, this has fueled the interest in knowledge graph summarization techniques that compute representative subgraphs for a given collection of nodes. In addition, many of the most densely connected entities in knowledge graphs are places and regions, often characterized by thousands of incoming and outgoing relationships to other places, actors, events, and objects. In this article, we propose a novel summarization method that incorporates spatially explicit components into a reinforcement learning framework in order to help summarize geographic knowledge graphs, a topic that has not been considered in previous work. Our model considers the intrinsic graph structure as well as the extrinsic information to gain a more comprehensive and holistic view of the summarization task. By collecting a standard data set and evaluating our proposed models, we demonstrate that the spatially explicit model yields better results than non-spatial models, thereby demonstrating that spatial is indeed special as far as summarization is concerned.},

  abstract = {Two characteristics of location-based services are mobile trajectories and the ability to facilitate social networking. The recording of trajectory data contributes valuable resources towards understanding users' geographical movement behaviors. Social networking is possible when users are able to quickly connect to anyone nearby. A social network with location based services is known as location-based social network (LBSN). As shown in Cho et al. [2013], locations that are frequently visited by socially related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. To better analyze and mine LBSN data, we need to have a comprehensive view of each of these two aspects, i.e., the mobile trajectory data and the social network. Specifically, we present a novel neural network model that can jointly model both social networks and mobile trajectories. Our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. First we adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key to our model lies in generating mobile trajectories. Second, we consider four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories: user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts, and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at the short or long term levels. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In particular, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.},

The estimation results suggest that air transport connectivity generally has a greater influence than rail transport on dyadic tourist flows, while connectivity provided by ordinary trains (compared to other rail types) is most important in the context of rail transport. Also, we find the effects of transport connectivity and intermodal transport competition to depend on the origin-to-destination distance. Different types of railway trains appear to have distinct effective distance ranges: the effect of high-speed rail trains is strongest at travel distances between 1,800 and 2,000 km, whereas bullet trains' effect is strongest at distances between 400 and 600 km.},

The assumption is that a higher frequency of occurrences of the name of city i in posts located in city j would imply that the city i is more influential than other cities upon city j. In addition, we've developed a group of measurements such as the relatedness index, impact index, link strength index, dependence index, and structure similar index to characterize such interactions. This framework of connectivity measurements can also be used to support smart planning taking into account the evolving interplay among cities.

  abstract = {Abstract: Existing urban boundaries are usually defined by government agencies for administrative, economic, and political purposes. However, it is not clear whether the boundaries truly reflect human interactions with urban space in intraand inter-regional activities. Defining urban boundaries that consider socioeconomic relationships and citizen commute patterns is important for many aspects of urban and regional planning. In this paper, we describe a method to delineate urban boundaries based upon human interactions with physical space inferred from social media. Specifically, we depicted the urban boundaries of Great Britain using a mobility network of Twitter user spatial interactions, which was inferred from over 69 million geo-located tweets. We define the nonadministrative anthropographic boundaries in a hierarchical fashion based on different physical movement ranges of users derived from the collective mobility patterns of Twitter users in Great Britain. The results of strongly connected urban regions in the form of communities in the network space yield geographically cohesive, non-overlapping urban areas, which provide a clear delineation of the non-administrative anthropographic urban boundaries of Great Britain. The method was applied to both national (Great Britain) and municipal scales (the London metropolis). While our results corresponded well with the administrative boundaries, many unexpected and interesting boundaries were identified. Importantly, as the depicted urban boundaries exhibited a strong instance of spatial proximity, we employed a gravity model to understand the distance decay effects in shaping the delineated urban boundaries. The model explains how geographical distances found in the mobility patterns affect the interaction intensity among different non-administrative anthropographic urban areas, which provides new insights into human spatial interactions with urban space.},

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the two main types of DNN architectures, are widely explored to handle various NLP tasks. CNN is supposed to be good at extracting positioninvariant features and RNN at modeling units in sequence. The state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks often switches due to the battle of CNNs and RNNs. This work is the first systematic comparison of CNN and RNN on a wide range of representative NLP tasks, aiming to give basic guidance for DNN selection.},

Specifically, this paper introduces LADAR based terrain evaluation algorithms for an urban environments as well as off road. The terrain evaluation algorithm is very important for safe driving at high speed. On the real road, the driver is faced with numerous road conditions such as the smoothness of the road surface, curbs, or debris. For an unmanned vehicle to be successful, the algorithm has to decide whether the surface is traversable or non-traversable. For this reason, this paper focuses on the problem of extracting the ground terrain surface from 3-D point clouds obtained from LADAR sensors. The paper outlines the approach used by the University of Florida's Team Gator Nation to address the question of classifying traversable road conditions.},

  abstract = {The research presented in this paper proposes a thematic network approach to explore rich relationships between places. We connect places in networks through their thematic similarities by applying topic modeling to the textual volunteered geographic information (VGI) pertaining to the places. The network approach enhances previous research involving place clustering using geo-textual information, which often simplifies relationships between places to be either in-cluster or out-of-cluster. To demonstrate our approach, we use as a case study in Manhattan (New York) that compares networks constructed from three different geo-textural data sources\&mdash;TripAdvisor attraction reviews, TripAdvisor restaurant reviews, and Twitter data. The results showcase how the thematic similarity network approach enables us to conduct clustering analysis as well as node-to-node and node-to-cluster analysis, which is fruitful for understanding how places are connected through individuals\&rsquo; experiences. Furthermore, by enriching the networks with geodemographic information as node attributes, we discovered that some low-income communities in Manhattan have distinctive restaurant cultures. Even though geolocated tweets are not always related to place they are posted from, our case study demonstrates that topic modeling is an efficient method to filter out the place-irrelevant tweets and therefore refining how of places can be studied.},

This technology is becoming a primary method for generating high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) that are essential to numerous applications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. Airborne LIDAR systems usually return a three-dimensional cloud of point measurements from reflective objects scanned by the laser beneath the flight path. In order to generate a DTM, measurements from nonground features such as buildings, vehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In this paper, a progressive morphological filter was developed to detect nonground LIDAR measurements. By gradually increasing the window size of the filter and using elevation difference thresholds, the measurements of vehicles, vegetation, and buildings are removed, while ground data are preserved. Datasets from mountainous and flat urbanized areas were selected to test the progressive morphological filter. The results show that the filter can remove most of the nonground points effectively.},

We used supervised machine learning to weigh the different fields of the Twitter message and the features of a world gazetteer to create a model that will prefer the correct gazetteer candidate to resolve the extracted expression.

However, most filtering algorithms need to carefully set up a number of complicated parameters to achieve high accuracy. In this paper, we present a new filtering method which only needs a few easy-to-set integer and Boolean parameters. Within the proposed approach, a LiDAR point cloud is inverted, and then a rigid cloth is used to cover the inverted surface. By analyzing the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface. Finally, the ground points can be extracted from the LiDAR point cloud by comparing the original LiDAR points and the generated surface. Benchmark datasets provided by ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) working Group III/3 are used to validate the proposed filtering method, and the experimental results yield an average total error of 4.58\%, which is comparable with most of the state-of-the-art filtering algorithms. The proposed easy-to-use filtering method may help the users without much experience to use LiDAR data and related technology in their own applications more easily.},

  abstract = {Many applications of volunteered geographic information (VGI) involve inferring the properties of the underlying population from a sample consisting of VGI observations, i.e. VGI sample. The representativeness of VGI sample is crucial for deciding the fitness for use of VGI in such applications. Due to the volunteers' opportunistic observation efforts, spatial distribution of VGI observations is often biased (i.e. spatial bias). This degrades the representativeness of VGI and impedes the quality of inference made from VGI. Extensive research has been conducted on assessing or assuring VGI quality from the perspective of the fundamental dimensions of spatial data quality. Yet, this perspective alone provides limited insights on the representativeness of VGI. Assessing VGI representativeness and developing novel approaches to accounting for spatial bias in VGI is in need for broadening the spectrum of VGI applications. This article offers a comprehensive survey of the scientific literature from various domains (ecology, statistics, machine learning, etc.) to summarize existing endeavors related to sample representativeness assessment and sample selection bias correction for enlightening the treatment of these issues in VGI applications.},

  abstract = {The road networks provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method first applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classifies image objects using the machine learning classifier, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square fitting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identification dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efficient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data.},

First point clouds were separated into ground and non-ground parts, and ground roads were to be extracted from ground planes. Then, buildings and trees were distinguished in an energy minimization framework after incorporation of two new features. The separation provided supportive information for later road extractions. After that, we designed structure templates to search for roads on ground intensity images, and road widths and orientations were determined by a subsequent voting scheme. This local searching process produced road candidates only, in order to prune false positives and infer undetected roads, a scene-dependent Markov network was constructed to help infer a global road network. Combination of local template fitting and global MRF inference made extracted ground roads more accurate and complete. Finally, we extended developed methods to elevated roads extraction from non-ground points and combined them with the ground road network to formulate a whole network.},

Research efforts are spent on dealing with new challenges and opportunities brought by the noisy, short, and context-rich nature of tweets. In this survey, we aim at offering an overall picture of location prediction on Twitter. Specifically, we concentrate on the prediction of user home locations, tweet locations, and mentioned locations. We first define the three tasks and review the evaluation metrics. By summarizing Twitter network, tweet content, and tweet context as potential inputs, we then structurally highlight how the problems depend on these inputs. Each dependency is illustrated by a comprehensive review of the corresponding strategies adopted in state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we also briefly review two related problems, i.e., semantic location prediction and point-of-interest recommendation.

Distant Supervision (DS) can automatically generate large-scale annotated data by aligning entity pairs from Knowledge Bases (KB) to sentences. However, these DSgenerated datasets inevitably have wrong labels that result in incorrect evaluation scores during testing, which may mislead the researchers. To solve this problem, we build a new dataset NYTH, where we use the DS-generated data as training data and hire annotators to label test data. Compared with the previous datasets, NYT-H has a much larger test set and then we can perform more accurate and consistent evaluation. Finally, we present the experimental results of several widely used systems on NYT-H. The experimental results show that the ranking lists of the comparison systems on the DS-labelled test data and human-annotated test data are different. This indicates that our human-annotated data is necessary for evaluation of distantly-supervised relation extraction.},

  abstract = {The semantics of directional prepositions is investigated from the perspective of aspect. What distinguishes telic PPs (like to the house) from atelic PPs (like towards the house), taken as denoting sets of paths, is their algebraic structure: atelic PPs are cumulative, closed under the operation of concatenation, telic PPs are not. Not only does this allow for a natural and compositional account of how PPs contribute to the aspect of a sentence, but it also guides our understanding of the lexical semantics of prepositions in important ways. Semantically, prepositions turn out to be quite similar to nouns and verbs. Nominal distinctions (like singular and plural, mass and count) and verbal classes (like semelfactives and degree achieve ments) have their prepositional counterparts.},
